     <h5>Step Summary</h5>
     <p>In this step we used the CreateProdAcct.ps1 script to create a Prod Account under 
        the Prod Organization Unit. We added a Administrators group to the account with 
        AdministratorAccess permissions. We added an IAM User for the account and added that 
        user to the Administrators group. We created a AWS CLI profile allowing the Management 
        Account IAM User to manage the Prod account with the OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
        policy.
     </p>
     <p>The IAM User created for this account will be used by the CI/CD process.</p>

     <h3>Publishing Stacks to Prod Account</h4>

         access to the Prod Account, you can publish stacks using either the AWS SAM CLI 
         or the Visual Studio IDE (Windows) AWS Toolkit Extensions.
