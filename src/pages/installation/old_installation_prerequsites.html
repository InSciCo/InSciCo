    <h4>Ready, Set, Go</h4>
    <p>Before you start the installation process, please review these 
        prerequisites. 
    </p>
    <h5>Management Workstation</h5>

    <p>This is the computer from which you will be creating/managing your AWS 
        Organization and Accounts. You must have administrative rights on this 
        computer to install and use a variety of software.</p>

    <h5>Development Workstation</h5>
    <p>This is the computer a developer uses to develop the application code that 
        runs in the AWS Stack. Each developer will have their own AWS Account. You 
        may use the Management Workstation as a Development Workstation. You must 
        have administrative rights on this computer to install and use a variety of
        software.</p>

   <h5>Names are Important</h5>
    <p>Part of setting up an effective AWS process is developing and using a consistent 
        naming convention for the resources you are managing with that process. There 
        is a hierarchy of AWS resources managed by the SMF that looks like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS Organization
            <ul>
                <li>Management Account</li>
                <li>Development Organizational Unit
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developer Account(s)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Test Organizational Unit
                    <ul>
                        <li>System Account(s)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Stack(s)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Production Organizational Unit
                    <ul>
                        <li>System Account(s)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Stack(s)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>OrgCode</h5>
        <p> Throughout the SMF process we use an organization prefix, the OrgCode, 
        in the AWS Management Account name, Developer Account names, and AWS organizational Unit names.
        For instance, we refer to the AWS Management account as "OrgMgmt", but expect you to replace 
        the "Org" with your own short OrgCode. It must be alpha-numeric and have no spaces. This short OrgCode will be very helpful in keeping track of accounts belonging to different organizations should you end up managing or developing in more than one organization on the same Workstation 
        <br>Here is an example of the naming with an OrdCode of "Isc":</p>
       
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th style="text-align: left">AWS Item</th>
                <th style="text-align: left">Name in Docs</th>
                <th style="text-align: left">Name with OrgCode "Isc"</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Management Account</td>
                <td>OrgMgmt</td>
                <td>IscMgmt</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dev Organizational Unit</td>
                <td>OrgDevOU</td>
                <td>IscDevOU</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dev Account</td>
                <td>OrgDevJoe</td>
                <td>IscDevJoe</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Test Organizational Unit</td>
                <td>OrgTestOU</td>
                <td>IscTestOU</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Prod Organizational Unit</td>
                <td>OrgProdOU</td>
                <td>IscProdOU</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>* Note: There many be more than one development account so we append the 
            developers "handle" to the account name; ex: IscDevJoe.
        </p>
        
    <h5>SysCode</h5>
    <p>Your organization may have one or more systems and each of these systems may 
        contain one or more serverless stacks. You create accounts for systems under the 
        Test Organizational Unit and Production Organizational Unit. 
        Throughout the SMF process we use the OrgCode and a system prefix, the SysCode, 
        in the System Account name.
        <br>Here is an example of the naming with an OrdCode of "Isc" and SysCode of "Pet":</p>        
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="text-align: left">AWS Item</th>
            <th style="text-align: left">Name in Docs</th>
            <th style="text-align: left">Name OrgCode "Isc", SysCode "Pet</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Test Account</td>
            <td>OrgSysTest</td>
            <td>IscPetTest</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prod Account</td>
            <td>OrgSysProd</td>
            <td>IscPetProd</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h5>Stack Names in the Test Account</h5>
    <p>Test Account Stacks are published when a developer opens a GitHub Pull Request. The 
        name of the PR branch is used to name the stack.
    </p>
    <p>Production Account Stacks may be named anyway you like.</p>


    <h5>Email Account & Alias</h5>
    <p> Each Amazon account has a Root User whose credentials include an email 
        address and password. The email address must be unique across all accounts 
        on AWS; e.g. you may not use the same email address for more than a single 
        AWS Account. <br> If you are using Gmail, you can use the Gmail dynamic aliasing technique as follows (with placeholders for OrgCode and SysCode shown):
    </p>
    <p>MyEmail@gmail.com -- existing email address.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>MyEmail+OrgMgmt@gmail.com -- root user for management account</li>
        <li>MyEmail+OrgDevJoe@gmail.com -- root user for Joe's development account</li>
        <li>MyEmail+OrgSysTest@gmail.com -- root user for test account</li>
        <li>MyEmail+OrgProd@gmail.com -- root user for production account</li>

    </ol>
    <p>The "+" character makes the email address a dynamic alias.<br>
        If you are not using Gmail, create email addresses or aliases 
        in your email software instead.</p>
