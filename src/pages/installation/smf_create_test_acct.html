   <h4>SMF 3.1 Create System Test Account</h4>
   <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- Create AWS Org complete</dd>
        <dd>- Unique email for root user of new account</dd>
        <dd>- OrgCode (used when organization was created)</dd>
        <dd>- SystemCode prefix (system short code to use for naming account)</dd>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt> 
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt> 
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>    

    <p>Perform this step to setup a new system test account. A system 
        is comprised of one or more serverless stacks. The newly created 
        system test account will be part of the OrgTestOU. Your OrgTestOU may 
        contain more than one system test account. Generally, you create 
        system test accounts to isolate and separately manage the AWS resources 
        in that system.
    </p>

    <h5>System Short Code</h5>
    <p>We prefix system test account names with the OrgCode and a SysCode. The 
        OrgCode should be the same prefix code used during the Create AWS Organization 
        step. The SysCode should be a short 2 or 3 character code identifying the 
        system the account is being created for. </p>
    <p>The system test account name template is "OrgSysTest" where "Org" is replaced 
        with your OrgCode and "Sys" is replaced with your SysCode.
    </p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a PowerShell Terminal.</li>
        <li>CD into the OrgMgmt folder. Using your OrgCode in place of "Org".</li>
        <li>Execute the Test_Account_Create.ps1 script:
             <pre><code class="language-bashshell">. .\Test_Account_Create.ps1</code></pre>
                     Here is a script run with sample inputs:
                     <pre><code class="language-bashshell">
 Test_Account_Create.ps1 - V1.0.0
 This script adds a System Test account to the Test Organizational Unit.
 Note: Press return to accept a default value.
 Enter your OrgCode (ex: Lz): Az
 Enter your AWS CLI Management Account Profile (default: AzMgmt):
 Enter Region (defautl us-east-1):
 Enter the Test OU Name (default: AzTestOU):
 Enter the System Handle (ex: Pet):Pet
 Enter the Test Account Name (default: AzPetTest): 
 Enter the Test IAM User Name (default: AzTest):
 Note: An email address can only be associated with one AWS Account. 
 Enter an Email Address for the new account's Root User: me+AzTest@gmail.com
 Please Review and Confirm the following:
     OrgCode: Az
     Management Account Profile: AzMgmt
     Test OU: AzTestOU
     System Test Account to be created: AzPetTest
     Test IAM User Name: AzPetTest
     Test Organization Unit: AzTestOU
     Email Address for Account's Root User: me+AzTest@gmail.com 
 Confirm y/n: y

    <li>Configure Account to User GitHub Personal Access Tokens
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Enter the following command:
                <pre><code class="language-bashshell">aws codebuild import-source-credentials --server-type GITHUB --auth-type PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN --profile OrgSysTestAccessRole --token githubtoken </code></pre><br>
                Replace "OrgSys" and "githubtoken" with your values.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    </ol> 

<h5>Step Summary</h5>
<p>In this step we used the Test_Account_Create.ps1 script to create a System Test Account under 
   the Test Organization Unit. We added a Administrators group to the account with 
   AdministratorAccess permissions. We added an IAM User for the account and added that 
   user to the Administrators group. We created a AWS CLI profile allowing the Management 
   Account IAM User to manage the System Test account with the OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
   policy. Finally we installed a GitHub PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in the account so our AWS CodeBuild 
   projects (created later) can access the GitHub account.
