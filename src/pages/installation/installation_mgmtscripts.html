    <h4>Management Scripts Setup</h4>
    <p>Prerequisites: AWS Mgmt Account Setup complete<br>
    Estimated time: 2 minutes, Cost: none<br>
    Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</p>
    <p>We provide PowerShell scripts to automate various steps in the setup and management 
        of your AWS Organization. You will not need to learn PowerShell scripting to use 
        these scripts.
    </p>
    <p>The scripts call the AWS CLI to configure your AWS Organization. They are easy to 
        read and heavily commented. We encourage you to read through the scripts and 
        follow the documentation links provided in the scripts to learn more about the 
        powerful commands in the AWS CLI.
