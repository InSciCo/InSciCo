    <h4>Management Scripts Setup</h4>
    <p>Prerequisites: AWS Mgmt Account Setup complete<br>
    Estimated time: 2 minutes, Cost: none<br>
    Perform this step on the Management Workstation. It is fine if this workstation 
    will also be used as a Developer's Workstation.</p>
    <p>We provide Microsoft PowerShell scripts to automate various steps in the setup and management 
        of your AWS Organization. You will not need to learn PowerShell scripting to use 
        these scripts. If you have Windows 10, PowerShell is already installed. If you are using 
        MacOS or some variant of Linux, PowerShell is available.
    </p>
    <p>The scripts call the AWS CLI to configure your AWS Organization. They are easy to 
        read and heavily commented. We encourage you to read through the scripts and 
        follow the documentation links provided in the scripts to learn more about the 
        powerful commands in the AWS CLI.

            Install PowerShell<br></a></li>
        <br>

        <li><a href="">Install Git Client</a> - if you do not already have it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Clone the LazyStackSMF git repository:
            <pre><code class="language-bashshell">git clone https://github.com/InSciCo/LazyStackSMF.git</code></pre>
            This creates a repository folder called LazyStackSMF.
        </li>
        <li>Change the name of the repository folder to "OrgMgmt"; replacing "Org" with 
            your OrgCode. This folder will become your reference folder for management related actions 
            on your organization's AWS Organization.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Step Summary</h4>
    <p>In this step we installed PowerShell and downloaded LazyStack management scripts into an OrgMgmt 
        folder.
