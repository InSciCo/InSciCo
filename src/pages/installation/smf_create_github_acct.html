    <h4>SMF 1.4 Create GitHub Account</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites: AWS Mgmt. Account Setup Complete</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt>
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>A GitHub account is required by LazyStack SMF. You will 
        be creating one GitHub repository for each serverless 
        stack in your AWS Organization. See the User Guide <a href="/userguide/smf_github.html"  {{>newtab}}>GitHub Integration</a> page for more details. 
       </p>
    <p>GitHub allows you create Organization accounts. However, you log into GitHub using a personal account and that account 
        is a member of an Organization. For a "greenfield" SMF Setup of a GitHub account, we assume you have a personal account 
        that has full access to the repositories your team will be using to develop serverless stacks. If you are using an existing 
        GitHub account, use personal account that has full access to serverless stack repositories. Later on, we use Personal Access Tokens to 
        configure AWS CodeBuild access to the GitHub repositories. So we generate and save a "Personal access token" in this step.
