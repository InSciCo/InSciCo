    <h4>SMF 1.4 Create GitHub Account</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites: AWS Mgmt. Account Setup Complete</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt>
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>A GitHub account is required by LazyStack SMF. You will be creating one GitHub repository for each serverless 
        stack in your AWS Organization. See the User Guide <a href="/userguide/smf_github.html"  {{>newtab}}>GitHub 
        Integration</a> page for more details. 
       </p>
    <p>GitHub allows you create Organization accounts. You log into GitHub using a personal account and that account 
        is a member of an Organization. SMF Setup requires you have a GitHub personal account that has full access to 
        the repositories your team will be using to develop serverless stacks. Later on, we use GitHub Personal Access Tokens to 
        configure AWS CodeBuild access to the GitHub repositories. So, in this step, we generate and save a "Personal access token" 
        we will use later on.
    </p>

    <ol>
       <li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/join" {{> newtab}}>Join GitHub</a> to create a GitHub Account if you don't already have on.
        If you don't already have one, create a GitHub Organization so you can associate GitHub developer accounts with repositories 
        created under that Organization.</li> 
       <li>Generate a Personal Access token:
           <ol type="a">
               <li>Log into the GitHub personal account that has access to the repositories you want to use.</li>
               <li>Click on the user profile icon in the upper right of the page. The user profile menu appears.</li>
               <li>Select the Settings menu item. The "personal account page" appears.</li>
               <li>Select "Developer Settings" from the left hand menu. The "Developer Settings" page appears.</li>
               <li>Select "Personal access tokens" from the left hand menu. The "Personal access tokens" page appears.</li>
               <li>Click on the Generate new token button. The "Confirm access" page appears. Note: GitHub may 
                   request your password at this point, provide it if requested. The "New personal access token" page appears"
               </li>
               <li>Enter a descriptive note, ex: "AWS CodeBuild Access".</li>
               <li>Check the "repo" option.</li>
               <li>Check the "admin:repo_hook" option.</li>
               <li>Click the "Generate token" button. The generated token is displayed.</li>
               <li>Copy this token and save it in a file named "GitHubToken.txt" in the OrgMgmt folder. Replace "Org" with your OrgCode.</li>
           </ol>
       </li>
       <li>Sign out of the GitHub account.</li>
    </ol>
