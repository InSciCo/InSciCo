    <p>This step is performed on the developer's workstation. The previous step produced a file
        like "OrgDevJoe_wecome.txt". Send this file ot the developer and have them follow the 
        steps in <a href="/installation/devtools_config_dev_ws.html">Configure Developer Workstation</a>.
        </p>       
        <p>If you are creating a developer's account on the Management Workstation you can also 
            use this process to configure the Management Workstation as a developer's workstation.
