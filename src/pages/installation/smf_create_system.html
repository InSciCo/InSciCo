<p>Systems are comprised of a System Test Account and a System Production Account. Systems 
    contain one or more Serverless Stacks, with each stack associated with a GitHub repository.    
</p>

<div class="manual-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Step 2.1 - Create System QuickStart</li>
        <li>Step 2.2 - Create Test Account</li>
        <li>Step 2.3 - Create Production Account</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h5>QuickStart</h5>
<p>Performing "2.1 - Create System QuickStart" performs the same processing as steps 2.2 and 2.3 
    and Config Repository steps 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Unless you have special requirements you should 
    use QuickStart to create a System. If you require more than one Serverless Stack in a System,
    you can use the "Config Repository" steps to add additional Serverless Stack repositories to 
    an existing stack created with QuickStart.
</p>

<p><strong>We recommend that you use "2.1 Create System QuickStart" to create an initial System called Tut 
    (short for Tutorial) to be used by you and your team to perform the LazyStackSMF tutorial.</strong>
