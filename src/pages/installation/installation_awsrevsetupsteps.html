<h5>Step Summary</h5>
<p>In this step we used the CreateTestAcct.ps1 script to create a Test Account under 
   the Test Organization Unit. We added a Administrators group to the account with 
   AdministratorAccess permissions. We added an IAM User for the account and added that 
   user to the Administrators group. We created a AWS CLI profile allowing the Management 
   Account IAM User to manage the Test account with the OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
   policy.
</p>
<p>The IAM User created for this account will be used by the CI/CD process.</p>
