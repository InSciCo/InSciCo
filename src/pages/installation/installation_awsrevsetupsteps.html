<h5>Step Summary</h5>
<p>In this step we used the CreateRevAcct.ps1 script to create a Review Account under 
   the Review Organization Unit. We added a Administrators group to the account with 
   AdministratorAccess permissions. We added an IAM User for the account and added that 
   user to the Administrators group. We created a AWS CLI profile allowing the Management 
   Account IAM User to manage the Review account with the OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
   policy.
</p>
<p>The IAM User created for this account will be used by the CI/CD process.</p>

<h3>Publishing Stacks to Review Account</h4>
<p>Using the Management Workstation (which has a profile allowing administrative 
   access to the Review Account, you can publish stacks using either the AWS SAM CLI 
   or the Visual Studio IDE (Windows) AWS Toolkit Extensions.
