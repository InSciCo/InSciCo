    <h3>LazyStack Development Tools</h3>
    <p>The LazyStack Development tools are available as a Visual Studio IDE (Windows) 
        extension and as .Net CLI tools. The Visual Studio IDE (MacOS) may be 
        configured to use the .Net CLI Tools. The .Net CLI tools can be used in 
        any environment supporting .NET.
    </p>

    <h4>.NET CLI LazyStack Tools - Mandatory</h4>
    <p>We recommend that all development workstations  have the .NET CLI LazyStack Tools 
        installed.
    </p>

    <h4>Visual Studio IDE (Windows) with LazyStack Extension - Optional</h4>
    <p>We recommend that Visual Studio IDE (Windows) users use the LazyStack extension 
        available from the Visual Studio Extension Marketplace. 
    </p>

    <h4>Visual Studio IDE (MacOS) with .NET CLI LazyStack Tools - Optional</h4>
    <p>Visual Studio IDE (MacOS) is supported using through the External Tools 
        feature. Unfortunately, the Visual Studio Extensions Gallery is no longer 
        accepting submissions. But, no worries, the External Tools configuration is 
        simple and works quite well.
    </p>

    <h4>Visual Code and other IDEs and Editors - Optional</h4>
    <p>Like Visual Studio IDE (MacOS), many editors and IDEs have the ability to 
        make calls to CLI tools. If you are working in one of these editors or IDEs,
        review the Visual Studio IDE (MacOS) setup. This setup is likely similar to 
        what you need.
