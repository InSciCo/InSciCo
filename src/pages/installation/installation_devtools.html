    <h3>LazyStack Development Tools</h3>
    <p>The LazyStack Development Tools run on your development workstation. We provide integrations for the Visual Studio 
        IDE and .NET Command Line Tool. Most editors, like Visual Studio Code, provide a means to call the .NET CLI through 
        the editor's UI so you can tailor your editor to use the LazyStack tools easily.
    </p>
    <p>The LazyStack .NET CLI Tool should always be installed.
    The other client integrations are optional but highly recommended.</p>
