        created a Developers group and in the new Dev Account, created a new IAM 
        User for the developer and assigned that IAM User to the Developers group. The 
        Developers Group contains a policy allow the developer to publish up to 
        three Serverless Stacks with the pre-defined names SS1, SS2, SS3.

    <p>The pre-defined Serverless Stack names are required to associate necessary 
        IAM permissions to the Developers IAM User account to successfully publish 
        Serverless Stacks.
