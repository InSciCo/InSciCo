    <h4>SMF Step 4 - Create Stack</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites: Create System (Step 3) complete</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt>
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>In this step you create one or more Serverless Stacks for a System. Each 
        stack has it's own GitHub repository.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>4.1 Create GitHub Repository for Serverless Stack</li>
        <li>4.2 Configure System Test Account for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</li>
        <li>4.3 Configure System Production Account for Continuous Deployment</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note: If you do not yet have a stack to define you can stop the SMF
        setup here and come back to this step later.</strong></p>
