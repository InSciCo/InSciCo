    <h4>SMF Preparation</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- A workstation with internet access and permissions to install software</dd>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 10 minutes</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt>
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>
    <h5>GitHub Organization and AWS Organization</h5>
    <p>LazyStack configures a GitHub Organization and an AWS Organization. Integrations
        are provided that make collaboration on the development and deployment of AWS
        Serverless Stacks simple. You may create a GitHub Account and Organization
        or configure an existing GitHub Account and Organization.</p>

    <h5>Management Workstation</h5>

    <p>This is the computer from which you will be creating/managing your GitHub Organization, AWS
        Organization, and Accounts. You must have administrative rights on this
        computer to install and use a variety of software with administrative rights.</p>
    <p>We will configure your Management Workstation with two folders, collocated under a
        common folder. For example, on a Windows workstation this might look like:
    </p>
    <div class="manual-list">
        <ul class="manual-list">
            <li>C:\Users\User\source\repos\
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LazyStackSMF</strong> - a GitHub clone of InSciCo/LazyStackSMF</li>
                    <li><strong>LazyStackSettings</strong> - a folder containing your organization settings.
                    </li>
                </ul>
    </div>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to consider that the <strong>LazyStackSettings</strong> folder will contain highly sensitive
        information and should only be accessible by persons who administer your GitHub and AWS organizations. You may
        name the LazyStackSettings folder anything you like. Throughout this documentation we will refer to this 
        folder as the LazyStackSettings folder.</p>

    <h5>OrgCode</h5>
    <p> Throughout the SMF process we use an AWS organization code, the OrgCode,
        in the AWS Management Account name, Developer Account names, and AWS organizational Unit names.
        For instance, we refer to the AWS Management account as "OrgMgmt", but expect you to replace
        the "Org" with your own short OrgCode. It must be alpha-numeric and have no spaces. This short OrgCode will be
        very helpful in keeping track of accounts belonging to different organizations should you end up managing or
        developing in more than one organization on the same Workstation.
        <br>Here is an example of the naming with an OrdCode of "Isc":
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="text-align: left">AWS Item</th>
            <th style="text-align: left">Name in Docs</th>
            <th style="text-align: left">Name with OrgCode "Az"</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Management Account</td>
            <td>OrgMgmt</td>
            <td>AzMgmt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dev Organizational Unit</td>
            <td>OrgDevOU</td>
            <td>AzDevOU</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dev Account</td>
            <td>OrgDevJoe</td>
            <td>AzDevJoe</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Test Organizational Unit</td>
            <td>OrgTestOU</td>
            <td>AzTestOU</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prod Organizational Unit</td>
            <td>OrgProdOU</td>
            <td>AzProdOU</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>* Note: There many be more than one development account so we append the
        developers "handle" to the account name; ex: AzDevJoe.
    </p>
    <p>Your GitHub Organization can be named anyway you like. You may use an existing
        GitHub Organization instead of creating one from scratch.
    </p>

    <h5>SysCode</h5>
    <p>Your AWS organization may have one or more systems and each of these systems may
        contain one or more serverless stacks. Each System has one System Test AWS Account 
        and one System Production AWS Account. Throughout the SMF process we use the OrgCode 
        and a system code, the SysCode, in the System Account name.
        <br>Here is an example of the naming with an OrdCode of "Az" and SysCode of "Pet":
    </p>
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="text-align: left">AWS Item</th>
            <th style="text-align: left">Name in Docs</th>
            <th style="text-align: left">Name OrgCode "Az", SysCode "Pet"</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Test Account</td>
            <td>OrgSysTest</td>
            <td>AzPetTest</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prod Account</td>
            <td>OrgSysProd</td>
            <td>AzPetProd</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h5>Stack Names in the Test Account</h5>
    <p>Test Account Stacks are published when a developer opens a GitHub Pull Request. The
        name of the PR branch is used to name the stack.
    </p>
    <p>Production Account Stacks may be named anyway you like as long as they follow AWS Stack Name conventions.</p>


    <h5>Email Account & Alias</h5>
    <p> Each Amazon account has a Root User whose credentials include an email
        address and password. The email address must be unique across all accounts
        on AWS; e.g. you may not use the same email address for more than a single
        AWS Account. <br> If you are using Gmail, you can use the Gmail dynamic aliasing technique as follows (with
        placeholders for OrgCode and SysCode shown):
    </p>
    <p>MyEmail@gmail.com -- existing email address with an OrgCode of "Az" and SysCode of "Pet".</p>
    <ol>
        <li>MyEmail+AzMgmt@gmail.com -- root user for management account</li>
        <li>MyEmail+AzDevJoe@gmail.com -- root user for Joe's development account</li>
        <li>MyEmail+AzPetTest@gmail.com -- root user for system test account</li>
        <li>MyEmail+AzPetProd@gmail.com -- root user for system production account</li>

    </ol>
    <p>The "+" character makes the email address a dynamic alias.<br>
        If you are not using Gmail, create email addresses or aliases
        in your email software instead.</p>
