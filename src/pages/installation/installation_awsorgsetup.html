    <h3>AWS Organization Setup</h4>
    <p>Prerequisites: AWS Mgmt Account Setup complete.</p>

    <p>We break the AWS Setup process up into 2 parts. Completing this Part 1 implements the 
        "bones" of your AWS organization and creates your first developer account; this is all you need to  
         proceed with the LazyStack Tutorial. Completing Part 2 implements the Test and 
         Production accounts with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment capabilities.
    </p>

    <h4>AWS Organizational Units and Member Accounts</h4>
            <p>
            We create an AWS Organization containing one Organizational Units (OU): 
            OrgDevOU. We create a developer Member Account and 
            put it in the OrdDevOU. When complete, your initial AWS Organization will 
            look something like this:</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/AwsSetupPart1.svg">  

        <p></p>
        <p>We prefix each account in our organization with a short "OrdCode", in the example above 
            this is "Org" in "OrgMgmt", "OrgDevOU" and "OrgDevJoe"; choosing a short but meaningful 
            code makes working with multiple organizations or different applications less confusing. 
        </p>

        <h5>Insight: </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>DynamoDB and S3 are provisioned in the account, not inside the serverless stack. 
                These services are shared for all stacks in that account. For instance, if you 
                have two stacks that both use DynamoDB, they should each use different tables
                to segregate their data.</li>
        </li>
        </ul> 

<h4>AWS Users and AWS CLI Profiles</h4>
<p>Each Account has a Root User and one or more IAM Users. Root users sign into an account 
    using their email address and password. IAM Users sign into the account using the 
    AccountID, UserName and Password. You can, and should, add MFA to Root User access and 
    IAM User access.
</p>
<p>The AWS CLI allows programmatic access to Accounts using credentials stored in "profiles" 
    on your workstation. Since an organization has multiple accounts, we use "named" profiles 
    when issuing AWS CLI commands to ensure we always update the correct account. 
    The AWS CLI allows the creation of a "default" profile. We recommend that this be used 
    with care on a workstation with access to multiple accounts. For instance, we do not 
    recommend that the AWS Organization Management Account credentials be stored in the 
    AWS CLI "default" profile.
</p>
<p>When Part 1 is complete, your organization's AWS Root Users and IAM Users will be organized  
    like this:</p>

<p></p>
<h5>Insights:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Root User access to the Management Account is infrequent and largely relegated to actions one 
        would take in the AWS Console.
    </li>
    <li>We only create AWS CLI Profiles for IAM Users.</li>    
    <li>Root User access to Member Accounts is very-rarely necessary and these login-credentials should not be shared.</li>
    <li>The IAM User LzMgmt can assume the OrganizationAccountAccessRole to administer Member Accounts. For example,
        the AWS CLI Profile LzDevJoeAccess is used to administer the OrgDevJoe Member Account from the OrgMgmt Management Account when using the AWS CLI.
    </li>
    <li>Root Users sign-in with at least an email address and password. An email address can be used
        with only one AWS account. Use email address aliases to be a root user in different AWS accounts.
    </li>
    <li>IAM users sign-in with at least an account#, user name, and password. The user-name is unique 
        within the account.</li>
</ul>
