    <h4>SMF Step 4 - Add Developers</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- Create AWS Organization (Step 1) complete</dd>
        <dd>- Unique Email address (or alias) to use for Developer Account</dd>
        <dd>- By default, AWS limits AWS Organizations to 4 accounts. Request more accounts if needed.</dd>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt> 
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt> 
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>

    <p>In this step we create a AWS Account for a developer (4.1) and then configure the developer's 
        workstation (4.2). Note that the Management Workstation may also be used as a Developer's Workstation.
    </p>
    <p>As stated above in the Prerequisites, AWS limits an AWS Organization to 4 accounts by default. In this 
        initial setup, which includes 1 developer account, we will be creating a total of 4 accounts. If you
        need more that 1 developer, you will need to request AWS increase the maximum number of accounts 
        in your AWS Organization.
    </p>
