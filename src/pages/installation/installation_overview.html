    <h3>Installation Overview</h4>
    <p>LazyStack is comprised of two resources: The LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF) and 
        the LazyStack Development Tools. Both can be used independently; or used together with seamless integration.
    </p>
    <h4>LazyStack AWS Software Management Framework (SMF)</h4>
    <p>All the scripts, templates, and instructions to setup a complete Software 
        Development, Testing and Deployment collaboration tool chain on AWS and GitHub. </p>

    <p>The installation of the SMF is broken up into two parts. In part 1 you create your AWS Organization, a 
        Development Organizational Unit and a Developer account; this is enough perform the LazyStack 
        Tutorial. In part 2 you create your Test and Production Organizational Units, Test and Production Accounts, 
        integrate with GitHub, and install the CI/CD tools. You do not have to be a 
        DevOps guru to install the SMF. The SMF setup includes:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Part 1 <br>
                Minimum Setup to run the LazyStack Tutorial:
                <ul>
                    <li>AWS Management Account</li>
                    <li>AWS Organizational Units for Development, Test and Production</li>
                    <li>Developer Account(s) - supporting developer sandbox stacks</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Part 2 <br>
                Complete your tool-chain to start collaborating on and publishing a commercial application
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub Software Versioning and Collaboration</li>
                    <li>Test Account - supporting test stacks with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</li>
                    <li>Production Account  - supporting production stacks with Continuous Deployment (CD)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Quick & Dirty</h4>
    <p>In a hurry? Already have a Software Management tool chain and just want to evaluate the LazyStack Development Tools? </p>
        <p>
        No worries; you can run through the LazyStack tutorial in any AWS account with Administrative access. 
        The LazyStack Developer tools do not require the AWS SMF.
    </p>

    <h4>LazyStack Development Tools</h4>
    <p>The LazyStack Development Tools run on your development workstation. Because these tools are provided as a .NET CLI Tool, they 
        can be run anywhere .NET is installed (Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.). We also provide integrations for the Visual Studio 
        IDE. Most editors, like Visual Studio Code, provide a means to call the .NET CLI through the editor's UI so you can 
        also tailor your editor to use the LazyStack tools from the editor UI.
    </p>
    <h4>Free - Forever</h4>
    <p>A free version of the LazyStack Generator is available as a Visual Studio Extension and as a .NET Core CLI tool.
        We will continue to enhance and publish the free version going forward to support small business and 
        entrepreneur efforts to field commercial grade applications quickly at a very low cost.
    </p>
    <h4>No Lock In</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintenance</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code can be manually maintained and enhanced 
            so there is no code "lock-in".</li>
        <li><strong>No Proprietary Dependencies</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code produced by the LazyStack 
             Generator have no proprietary LazyStack dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>MIT Licensed Libraries</strong> - We maintain the LazyStackLibs repository on GitHub containing
            libraries and utilities primarily focused on supporting LazyStack generated clients and stacks. Everything 
            in the LazyStackLibs repository is released under the very permissive open-source MIT license.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Enterprise Version in Development</h4>
    <p>
        An Enterprise version of the LazyStack Generator, with features far beyond those in the free version, is in 
        development. The Enterprise version features will serve the needs of larger organizations with very sophisticated 
        requirements. However, we are committed to support the needs of the entrepreneur in the free version as well!
