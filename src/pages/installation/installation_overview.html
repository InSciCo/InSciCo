    <h3>Installation Overview</h4>
    <p>LazyStack install is broken up into two independent components:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/installation/smf_overview.html">Configure Software Management Framework (SMF)</a><br>
            Setup an AWS Organization supporting multiple developers collaborating through GitHub with GitHub 
            Pull Requests. Provide application test accounts supporting Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. 
            Provide application production accounts with Continuous Deployment. The workstation on which this setup is 
            run is called the "Management Workstation" and will be configured with a number of LazyStack 
            automation scripts to make creating and managing your AWS Organization a snap. A Development 
            Workstation can also be a Management Workstation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="/installation/devtools_config_dev_ws.html">Configure Development Workstation</a> <br>
                Setup a developer's workstation with AWS and LazyStack tools to develop and test serverless stacks.<br> <strong>
                Note: Any workstation with access to an AWS Account with Administrative access may install and use the LazyStack tools. 
                It is recommended, but not necessary, to perform the SMF configuration to create and manage Developer Accounts and 
                then configure the developer's workstation to use that AWS Account and LazyStack Tools.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Free - Forever</h4>
    <p>A free version of the LazyStack Generator is available as a Visual Studio Extension and as a .NET Core CLI tool.
        We will continue to enhance and publish the free version going forward to support small business and 
        entrepreneur efforts to field commercial grade applications quickly at a very low cost.
    </p>
    <h4>No Lock In</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintenance</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code can be manually maintained and enhanced 
            so there is no code "lock-in".</li>
        <li><strong>No Proprietary Dependencies</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code produced by the LazyStack 
             Generator have no proprietary LazyStack dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>MIT Licensed Libraries</strong> - We maintain the LazyStackLibs repository on GitHub containing
            libraries and utilities primarily focused on supporting LazyStack generated clients and stacks. Everything 
            in the LazyStackLibs repository is released under the very permissive open-source MIT license.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Enterprise Version in Development</h4>
    <p>
        An Enterprise version of the LazyStack Generator, with features far beyond those in the free version, is in 
        development. The Enterprise version features will serve the needs of larger organizations with very sophisticated 
        requirements. However, we are committed to support the needs of the entrepreneur in the free version as well!
