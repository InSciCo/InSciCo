    <h3>Installation Overview</h4>
    
    <h4>LazyStack AWS Software Management Framework (SMF)</h4>
    <p>We provide all scripts, templates, and instructions to setup a complete Software 
        Development, Testing and Deployment tool chain on AWS. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS Management Account</li>
            <li>AWS Organizational Units for Development, Test and Production</li>
            <li>Developer(s) Account</li>
            <li>Test Account - with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</li>
            <li>Production Account  - with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The LazyStack Development Tools do not require that you use the SMF. We strongly suggest 
        that you implement the SMF if you do not already have an existing Software Management 
        tool chain and intend to field a production application.</p>

    <h4>Quick & Dirty</h4>
    <p>You can run through the LazyStack tutorial in an AWS account with Administrative access. 
        This is handy if you are evaluating only the LazyStack Tools and intend to use those 
        tools in an existing Software Management tool chain later on. The LazyStack AWS SMF is 
        not required by the LazyStack Tools.
    </p>

    <h4>LazyStack Development Tools</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Studio Windows - installation for Visual Studio IDE for Windows</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Mac - installation for Visual Studio IDE for Mac</li>
        <li>.NET CLI Tool - installation for non-IDE users (Visual Studio Code users should use this)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Free - Forever</h4>
    <p>A free version of the LazyStack Generator is available as a Visual Studio Extension and as a .NET Core CLI tool.
        We will continue to enhance and publish the free version going forward to support small business and 
        entrepreneur efforts to field commercial grade applications quickly at a very low cost.
    </p>
    <h4>No Lock In</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintenance</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code can be manually maintained and enhanced 
            so there is no code "lock-in".</li>
        <li><strong>No Proprietary Dependencies</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code produced by the LazyStack 
             Generator have no proprietary LazyStack dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>MIT Licensed Libraries</strong> - We maintain the LazyStackLibs repository on GitHub containing
            libraries and utilities primarily focused on supporting LazyStack generated clients and stacks. Everything 
            in the LazyStackLibs repository is released under the very permissive open-source MIT license.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Enterprise Version in Development</h4>
    <p>
        An Enterprise version of the LazyStack Generator, with features far beyond those in the free version, is in 
        development. The Enterprise version features will serve the needs of larger organizations with very sophisticated 
        requirements. However, we are committed to support the needs of the entrepreneur in the free version as well!
