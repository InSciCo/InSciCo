    <h3>Installation Overview</h4>
    <h4>Free - Forever</h4>
    <p>A free version of the LazyStack Generator is available as a Visual Studio Extension and as a .NET Core CLI tool.
        We will continue to enhance and publish the free version going forward to support small business and 
        entrepreneur efforts to field commercial grade applications quickly at a very low cost.
    </p>
    <h5>No Lock In</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintenance</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code can be manually maintained and enhanced 
            so there is no code "lock-in".</li>
        <li><strong>No Proprietary Dependencies</strong> - The stack configurations and generated code produced by the LazyStack 
             Generator have no proprietary LazyStack dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>MIT Licensed Libraries</strong> - We maintain the LazyStackLibs repository on GitHub containing
            libraries and utilities primarily focused on supporting LazyStack generated clients and stacks. Everything 
            in the LazyStackLibs repository is released under the very permissive open-source MIT license.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Enterprise Version in Development</h4>
    <p>
        An Enterprise version of the LazyStack Generator, with features far beyond those in the free version, is in 
        development. The Enterprise version features will serve the needs of larger organizations with very sophisticated 
        requirements. However, we are committed to support the needs of the entrepreneur in the free version as well!
