    <h4>Developer Profile Setup</h4>
    <p>Prerequisites: Developer Account Creation complete<br>
        Estimated Time: 2 minutes, Costs: none<br>
        Perform this step on the Development Workstation</p>    
    <p>In this step we create access keys and a AWS CLI profile, using those, keys for 
        the developer to access their account using their IAM User credentials.
    </p>
    <p>It is important that this operation be performed on the Developers Workstation. There
        is no reason for the access keys for the IAM User, for example AzDevJoe, to be stored 
        anywhere other than the developer's workstation. 
    </p>
    <p>Todo</p>
