    <h4>SMF 4.2 Setup Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for System Test Account Stack</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- Create Test Account (3.1) complete</dd>
        <dd>- Create GitHub Repository (4.1) complete</dd>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt> 
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt> 
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>  
    <p>This script deploys two CodeBuild project stacks to a System Test Account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Test_CodeBuild_PR_Create.yaml defines the first CodeBuild project stack</li>
        <li>Test_CodeBuild_PR_Merge.yaml defines the second CodeBuild project stack</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These .yaml template files are in your OrgMgmt folder.</p>

    <p>Each project is associated with a GitHub repository containing a serverless application stack.
        Test_CodeBuild_PR_Create.yaml defines a CodeBuild project stack that builds, tests and publishes
        an application stack when a Pull Request is created or updated in the GitHub repository.
        The published stack is called the PR stack. The stack is named based on the 
        PR branch name.
        Test_CodeBuild_PR_Merge.yaml defines a CodeBuild project stack that deletes the PR stack
        when a Pull Request is merged in the GitHub application repository.</p>

    
    <p>You repeat this step for each GitHub repository used in a Test System Account.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>If you do not already have a CodeBuild GitHub Connection for the Test Account, follow these steps to create
            one:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Log into the AWS OrgTest account using the OrgTest IAM User credentials.</li>
                <li>Select correct region (top right corner of AWS console menu bar).</li>
                <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?" {{>newtab}}>CodeBuild</a> Console</li>
                <li>Select Settings &rightarrow; Connections in navigation pane. The Developer Tools > Connections page appears.</li>                
                <li>Click the Create Connection Button. The Create Connection page appears.</li>
                <li>Select the GitHub radio button and enter a connection name.</li>
                <li>Click on the Connect to GitHub button. You will be prompted to log into GitHub if you are not already logged in The Connect to GitHub page appears.</li>
                <li>Click on the "Install a new app" button. The GitHub "Install AWS Connector for GitHub" page appears with a list of accounts you have access to. Select identity under which you have 
                    access to the application repository used by this CI/CD setup. The AWS Connector for GitHub
                    page appears.
                </li>
                <li>Use the options on the page to configure the connector's access to the repository.
                </li>
                <li>Click the Save button.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Open a PowerShell Terminal.</li>
        <li>CD into the OrgMgmt folder. Using your OrgCod in place of "Org"</li>
        <li>Execute the Test_CodeBuild_Deploy.ps1 script.

            Here is a script run with sample inputs:

Test_CodeBuild_Deploy.ps1 - V1.0.0
This script deploys two CodeBuild project stacks to a System Test Account.
   - Test_CodeBuild_Create.yaml defines the first CodeBuild project stack
   - Test_CodeBuild_Merge.yaml defines the second CodeBuild project stack
Each project is associated with a GitHub repository containing a serverless application stack.

Test_CodeBuild_Create.yaml defines a CodeBuild project stack that builds, tests and publishes
an application stack when a Pull Request is created or updated in the GitHub repository.
The published stack is called the PR stack. The stack is named based on the PR branch name.

Test_CodeBuild_Merge.yaml defines a CodeBuild project stack that deletes an application stack
when a Pull Request is merged in the GitHub application repository.

<h4>Modifying the CodeBuild Project Stack Templates</h4>
<p>It is often necessary to modify the CodeBuild Project Stack templates to accommodate 
    your specific application stack build, test and deploy process. This is best accomplished by 
    making copies of the Test_CodeBuild_PR_Create.yaml and Test_CodeBuild_PR_Merge.yaml files 
    and editing them as necessary. Then, reference edited templates when running the 
    Test_CodeBuild_Deploy.ps1 script. The usual  edits will be in the CodeBuild Project Script 
    section. This script section contains a simple csh script that makes calls to dotnet 
     and the AWS SAM CLI as shown below:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Test_CodeBuild_PR_Create.yaml - script
        <pre><code class="language-bashshell"># csh script                                                                    
# stack names can not include / characters so we replace with -
- stack=$(echo $CODEBUILD_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER | sed 's/\//-/g')
- dotnet build --configuration Release
# ${S3} is replaced during cloudformation template processing with S3 name
# $stack is replaced by csh
- eval "aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $stack"</code></pre> 
    </li>
    <li>Test_CodeBuild_Merge.yaml - script section
        <pre><code class="language-bashshell"># csh script                                                                    
# stack names can not include / characters so we replace with -
- stack=$(echo $CODEBUILD_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER | sed 's/\//-/g')
- dotnet build --configuration Release
# $stack is replaced by csh
- eval "aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $stack"</code></pre> 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Updating CodeBuild Projects</h4>
<p>You can rerun this script anytime you need to update CodeBuild Projects.</p>

<h4>Step Summary</h4>
<p>In this step we deployed two CodeBuild project stacks that reference a 
    GitHub repository. When Pull Requests are created or updated the 
    CodeBuild project stack, defined by the Test_CodeBuild_Create.yaml template,
    builds, tests and deploys a PR stack.
</p>
<p>When Pull Requests are merged the CodeBuild project stack, defined by the 
    Test_CodeBuild_Merge.yaml template, deletes the PR stack.
