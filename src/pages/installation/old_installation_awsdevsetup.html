    <h3>AWS Developer Environment Overview</h4>
    <p>The steps outlined in this guide create your AWS Management account, a Root Organization, 
        a Development Organization Unit, and a Developer Account. Here is what we will be creating:
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/img/AwsDevSetup2.svg">  
    
    <p></p>
    <p>Note the nesting of the structural elements of this environment:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Root Organization
            <ul>
                <li>Org Policies</li>
                <li>Management Account</li>
                <li>Development Organization Unit
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dev Policies</li>
                        <li>Development Account - (Member Account)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Serverless Stack(s)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>    
    </ul>
    <p>This simple environment is sufficient to allow the developer to build and publish 
        ASW Serverless stacks to their development account using the AWS SAM CLI or 
        Visual Studio (Windows) IDE AWS Toolkit extension.
    </p>
    <h5>Insight: </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>You are not limited to one Development Account. You can add additional 
            Development Accounts to this Development Organization Unit as you need 
            them. Please only add one at this time as the default number of accounts 
            allowed in an Organization is 4. You may request a higher limit.
        </li>
        <li>The account shows DynamoDB and S3 outside the serverless stack. 
            These services are shared for all stacks in that account. For instance, if you 
            have two stacks that both use DynamoDB, they should each use different tables
            to segregate their data.</li>
    </ul>     

    <h5>AWS Users</h5>
    <p>Accounts have users and users often have different privileges. Here are the users 
        we will be creating:
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/img/AwsDevSetup.svg">  
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Management Account - there is only ever one Management account in an organization
            <ul>
                <li>Root User - this user is rarely used. This account is logged into using 
                    an email address and password. You can, and should, also set this account 
                    up to use MFA.
                </li>
                <li>Admin User - an IAM user assigned to a security group allowing required 
                    administrative actions. IAM users login to using an Account ID, User Name,
                    and password. You can, and should, also set this user up to use MFA.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>LzDevJoe Account - this is a member account, there can be multiple member accounts
            <ul>
                <li>Root User - this user is rarely used.  This account is logged into using 
                    an email address and password. You can, and should, also set this account 
                    up to use MFA. Root User access need not be provided to the developer.
                </li>
                <li>LzDevJoe - an IAM User assigned to the Developer group. Note that these 
                    are rather broad permissions as the developer is using these permissions 
                    to publish Serverless stacks from their desktop.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h5>Account Naming</h5>
    <p>When you are signed into the AWS Console, you are always logged into an "account". Accounts 
        have unique Account ID numbers but you see the account name in the top bar of the 
        console. Account names are not unique! To make it really easy to keep track of which AWS 
        Organization Account you are currently working in, we recommend the following account 
        naming convention: &lt;OrganizationName>&lt;OrganizationUnitName>[&lt;UserName>].
    </p>
    <p>In this setup guide we assume you will create new AWS accounts using the following names:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Organization Name: Lz</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Email Accounts</h5>
    <p>Creating account root users require unique email addresses. We will be creating four 
        accounts (two in the first Development Setup step and two more in the Production Setup step) 
        so we will need four unique email addresses. 
        We will assume the use 
        of a Gmail account called me@gmail.com in these examples. Gmail allows you to use dynamic aliases 
        with your gmail account.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For example, me+lzdev@gmail.com is considered by AWS to be a different 
            email address than me+lzdev01@gmail.com. Any email sent to me+lzdev01@gmai.com will show up in your 
            me@gmail.com inbox. Throughout these guides we will use this dynamic email alias feature to 
            create unique email addresses where necessary.</p>
    <p> If you are using a corporate email system that 
            does not provide dynamic email addresses, you will need to create email aliases in that 
            system. </p>
