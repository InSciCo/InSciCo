    <h4>SMF 1.1 Configure Management Workstation</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites: none</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 to 10 minutes</dt> 
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt> 
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>    

    <p>We provide Microsoft PowerShell scripts to automate various steps in the setup and management 
        of your AWS Organization. You will not need to learn PowerShell scripting to use 
        these scripts. If you have Windows 10, PowerShell is already installed. If you are using 
        MacOS or some variant of Linux, PowerShell is available to install.
    </p>
    <p>The scripts call the AWS CLI to configure your AWS Organization. They are easy to 
        read and heavily commented. We encourage you to read through the scripts and 
        follow the documentation links provided in the scripts to learn more about the 
        powerful commands in the AWS CLI. 
    </p>

    <p>In this step, we will be creating a "OrgMgmt" folder on the Management Workstation containing 
        scripts and sensitive information. Give some thought as to where you will want this folder 
        to reside and who should have access to it.

        <!-- Install PowerShell -->
        <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1" {{>newtab}}>
            Install PowerShell<br></a> * If you are running Windows 10, PowerShell is already installed.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Install a Git client <br>
            * If you do not already have it.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" {{>newtab}}>GitBash for Windows</a> - this is our favorite for Windows</li>
                <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" {{>newtab}}>Git for MacOS, Linux/Unix, Windows</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Open a PowerShell terminal with "Run as Administrator" and issue the following command to change the PowerShell script execution permissions:
            <pre><code class="language-bashshell">Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</code></pre>
            This will allow you to run PowerShell scripts on the local computer which is generally necessary for the Management Workstation.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Close PowerShell. We don't need Administrator access for the next steps.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Open a PoserShell terminal and CD to the folder that will contain your "OrgMgmt" folder and then issue the following command 
            to clone the LazyStackSMF git repository:
            <pre><code class="language-bashshell">git clone https://github.com/InSciCo/LazyStackSMF.git</code></pre>
            The clone command creates a folder called LazyStackSMF.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Rename the folder "LazyStackSMF" to "OrgMgmt"; replace "Org" with your OrgCode. This folder will become 
            your reference folder for management related actions on your AWS Organization. 
        </li>
        <br>
    </ol>
    <h5>Step Summary</h5>
    <p>In this step we installed PowerShell, the Git client, and downloaded the LazyStack management scripts into an OrgMgmt folder.
    </p>
