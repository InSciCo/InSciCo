    <p>We provide Microsoft PowerShell scripts to automate various steps in the setup and management 
        of your AWS Organization. You will not need to learn PowerShell scripting to use 
        these scripts. If you have Windows 10, PowerShell is already installed. If you are using 
        MacOS or some variant of Linux, PowerShell is available to install.
    </p>
    <p>The scripts call the AWS CLI to configure your AWS Organization. They are easy to 
        read and heavily commented. We encourage you to read through the scripts and 
        follow the documentation links provided in the scripts to learn more about the 
        powerful commands in the AWS CLI.

        <br>

        <li>Open a PowerShell terminal with "Run as Administrator" and issue the following command to change the PowerShell script execution permissions:
            <pre><code class="language-powershell">Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</code></pre>
            This will allow you to run PowerShell scripts on the local computer which is generally necessary for the Management Workstation.</li>
