    <h3>Quick & Dirty - no SMF</h3>
    <p>If you just want to run through the LazyStack Tools tutorial, you can use an existing AWS 
        Account having Administrative privileges.</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend following the LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF) install 
        steps to get the most out of LazyStack. We believe this is the best approach even if you 
        intend to later integrate the LazyStack tools into an existing Software Management process
        as the SMF illustrates some important use-case implementation that may be of some help later.
