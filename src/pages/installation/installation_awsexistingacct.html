    <h3>Use Existing AWS Account</h3>
    <p>If you just want to run through the LazyStack tutorial, you can use an existing AWS 
        Account having Administrative privileges.</p>

    <p>It is possible to invite existing accounts to join an AWS Organization. If you have an account 
        in which you are current doing development, it may make more sense to create a new 
        Management Account and AWS Organization and then later invite your existing account 
        to join that organization.
    </p>
