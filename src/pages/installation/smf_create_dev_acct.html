    <h4>Step 5 ) Create Developer Account(s)</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- Organization Setup complete</dd>
        <dd>- Unique Email address (or alias) to use for Developer Account</dd>
         <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt> 
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt> 
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>      
    <p>In this step we will run the LzNewDevAcct.ps1 script to create a new Developer 
        AWS Sandbox Member Account belonging to the AWS organization and move this account into 
        the DevOU Organizational Unit. The AWS Account will have a IAM Policy Group called 
        Developers. The Developers Group will have two policies: PowerUsersAccess and 
        IAMUserCredsPolicy. PowerUsersAccess is an AWS Management Policy. IAMUserCredsPolicy is 
        created by this script from the provided IAMUserCredsPolicy.json file. 
    </p>
    <h5>Sometimes managing a developer's AWS Account is optional!</h5>
    <p>Developers do not always have to have an AWS Account to contribute to your application. 
        They only need to be able to make PR requests against an GitHub repository referenced by 
        one of your Systems. In addition, they could use their developer workstation to publish 
        a Serverless Stack directly to <strong>any</strong> AWS Account in which they have sufficient administrative 
        rights to do so. This can make it easy to have sub-contractors make contributions to your 
        codebase without your having to manage their AWS Accounts. However, if the Serverless Stacks 
        being deployed require accessing "shared" resources in other accounts you do manage, it is 
        best practice to allow that access only from developer AWS Accounts you manage.

    <h5>Configuration Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a PowerShell terminal.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CD into the LazyStackSMF folder.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Execute the LzNewDevAcct.ps1 script:
            <pre><code class="language-bashshell">..\LazyStackSMF\LzNewDevAccount.ps1</code></pre>
                    Here is a script run with sample inputs:
                    <pre><code class="language-bashshell">
Dev_Account_Create.ps1 - V1.0.0
This script adds a developer account to the Dev Organizational Unit.
Note: Press return to accept a default value.
Enter your OrgCode (ex: Lz): Az

Enter Region (default us-east-1):
Enter the Development OU Name (default: AzDevOU):
Enter the Developer's Handle (ex: Joe): Joe
Enter the Developer's Account Name (default: AzDevJoe): 
Enter the Developer's IAM User Name (default: AzDevJoe):
Note: An email address can only be associated with one AWS Account.

Please Review and Confirm the following:
    OrgCode: Az
    Management Account Profile: AzMgmt
    Development OU: AzDevOU
    Development Account to be created: AzDevJoe
    Development Account IAM User Name: AzDevJoe
    Development Organization Unit: AzDevOU

    <h5>Step Summary</h5>
    <p>In this step we used the Dev_Account_Create.ps1 script to create a new Dev Account 
        and move that account into the Dev Organizational Unit. The script also 
        created a Developers group and in the new Dev Account, created a new IAM 
        User for the developer and assigned that IAM User to the Developers group.
