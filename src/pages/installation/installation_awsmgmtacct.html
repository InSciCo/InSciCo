    <h3>AWS Management Account Setup</h3>
    <p>We recommend you create a new AWS Account if you intend to use our guides to 
        create an AWS Organization.</p>  
    <h5>Account Names</h5>
    <p>We recommend that you use a short "organization code" (OrgCode) to prefix all accounts and 
        users in your AWS Organization. For instance, we recommend that you name 
        your AWS Management Account something like "OrgMgmt" - where "Org" is the OrgCode.</p>
    <p>We recommend the OrgCode be no longer that 2 or 3 characters. It must be alpha-numeric 
        and have no spaces. This short OrgCode will be very helpful in keeping track of accounts 
        belonging to different organizations should you end up managing or developing in more than one 
        organization on the same Workstation.
    </p>
    <p>If you don't have a formal organization to derive the OrgCode from, you may want to consider 
        using this prefix to describe an App Stack you are building.
    </p>
    <p>Replace "Org" with your OrgCode whenever you see it in the guide steps.</p>
    <h4>New AWS Management Account Setup</h4>
    <p>Prerequisites: A valid email address (or alias) not used on any other AWS Account.<br>
        Estimated Time: 10 minutes, Costs: none<br>
        Perform this step on the Management Workstation. The Management Workstation can also be 
        a Development Workstation.
    </p>

        <!--Sign Up-->
        <li><a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup" {{>newtab}}>Sign up</a> for 
            an AWS account using your email address - this will become your AWS "Management" 
            account. Name this account "OrgMgmt" - replacing "Org" with your OrgCode.<br><br>
            Make a note of the email address and password used to create the account. You will 
            need this to login as the Account's "root" user.
            <br><br>

            Important: If you already have an AWS Account associated with your email, you will need to 
            create an email alias to create another AWS account. You can't use the same email address with 
            more than one AWS Account.<br><br>

            Tip: If you are using a Gmail account you 
            can create and use a dynamic alias using the special '+' operator. If your Gmail address 
            is "me@gmail.com", you can use the email address alias "me+OrgMgmt@gmail.com". Any email  
            sent to me+OrgMgmt@gmail.com will show up in your regular Gmail inbox.</li>

    <h5>Step Summary</h5>
    <p>In this step we created a new AWS Management Account, added an IAM User "OrgMgmt" with AdministratorAccess,
        Installed the AWS CLI on our workstation and configured a AWS CLI profile for the the IAM User
        "OrgMgmt". Now we can perform most administrative tasks on the Management Account using the 
        AWS CLI.
    </p>
    <p>You can now proceed to run the LazyStack tutorial in the Management Account for POC or 
        educational purposes or continue with setting up the AWS Organization SDLC.
