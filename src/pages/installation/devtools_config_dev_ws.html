    <h3>Configure Developer Workstation</h3>
    <p>The LazyStack Development Tools run on your development workstation. We provide integrations for the Visual
        Studio IDE and .NET Command Line Tool. Most editors, like Visual Studio Code, provide a means to call the .NET
        CLI through the editor's UI so you can also tailor your editor to use the LazyStack tools easily.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note: Any workstation with access to an AWS Account with Administrative access may install and use the LazyStack
        tools. If you are installing the dev tools on the SMF AWS Management Workstation, it is recommended, but not necessary, to 
        perform the SMF configuration prior to installing the LazyStack 
        tools and performing the LazyStack Tutorial. If you are installing on a development only workstation, you do not need to 
        perform the SMF install.</strong></p>
