    <h4>Steps 4) Create AWS Organization</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites: AWS Management Account Setup Complete</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 5 minutes</dt>
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt>
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>

    <p>In this step we will use the LazyStackSMF.ps1 script to create an AWS Organization, 
        AWS Organizational Units, and AWS Tutorial System Accounts with CI/CD pipelines.
    </p>
    <h5>Configuration Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a PowerShell terminal.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CD into the LayStackSettings folder.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Issue the following command:
            <pre><code class="language-powershell">..\LazyStackSMF\LzConfigure.ps1</code></pre>
            You will be prompted for the following:
            <ul>
                <li>OrgCode</li>
                <li>AWS Management Account Profile</li>
                <li>AWS Region</li>
                <li>GitHub Organization Name</li>
                <li>GitHub PetStore repository</li>
                <li>GitHub LazyStackSMF repository</li>
                <li>Email address for Tutorial System Test AWS Account</li>
                <li>Email address for Tutorial System Production AWS Account</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Common Issue - Payer ID (Don't panic!)</h5>
            <p>There is an occasional problem with setting the CodeBuild Personal Access Token for CodeBuild 
              projects during the creation of System accounts. This seems to be caused by some "timing" issue on 
              the AWS side of things. This results in a message, usually during the creation of the second 
              System Account (Production) where AWS complains "Could not retrieve the Payer ID".
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bashshell">552 |      throw ("Set-AwsCodeBuildCredentials failed, Error: " + $result)
    |      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    | Set-AwsCodeBuildCredentials failed, Error: System.Management.Automation.RemoteException An error
    | occurred (InvalidInputException) when calling the ImportSourceCredentials operation: Could not
    | retrieve the Payer ID. Reason: Subscription to CodeBuild, ProductCode CodeBuild, required.</code></pre>
      <p><strong>We have found that simply running the script a second time solves the problem. </strong></p>

            <h5>What to do if the script fails?</h5>
            <p>We have written the script to be fault tolerant. If you get an error, you should 
                receive a meaningful error message and the script will stop. You can then address 
                the underlying issue and re-run the script, it will pick up where it left off.
                
                If you get an error when running the script, it is most likely going to be because 
                of one of the following issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>AWS Management Account doesn't have appropriate permissions. This can happen when 
                    you are using an existing account instead of creating one from scratch using the 
                    the setup instructions in SMF Step 3.
                </li>
                <li>Maximum number of accounts exceeded. By default, AWS sets a maximum number of accounts 
                    for a new organization at 4. You may request additional accounts. If 
                    you are using LazyStack SMF to create a new AWS organization from scratch, you 
                    should not see this issue during the initial Setup.
                </li>
                <li>Non-unique email address. Every AWS Account must have a unique email address. If you  
                    supply an email address that has already been used (in the last 90 days) for an 
                    AWS account, the account creation process will fail. Re-run the script and provide 
                    a unique email address for each AWS Account.
                </li>
                <li>"Missing Payer ID" - this is likely a "timing" problem on the AWS side of things and you can 
                  usually just rerun the script again and it will succeed.
                </li>
            </ul>
