   <h4>SMF 2.3 Create System Production Account</h4>
   <dl>
        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- Create AWS Org complete</dd>
        <dd>- Unique email for root user of new account</dd>
        <dd>- OrgCode (used when organization was created)</dd>
        <dd>- SystemCode prefix (system short code to use for naming account)</dd>
        <dt>Estimated Time: 2 minutes</dt> 
        <dt>Estimated Cost: none</dt> 
        <dt>Perform this step on the Management Workstation.</dt>
    </dl>    

    <p>Perform this step to setup a new system Production account. A system 
        is comprised of one or more serverless stacks. The newly created 
        system Production account will be part of the OrgProdOU. Your OrgProdOU may 
        contain more than one system Production account. Generally, you create 
        system Production accounts to isolate and separately manage the AWS resources 
        in that system.
    </p>

    <h5>System Short Code</h5>
    <p>We prefix system Prod account names with the OrgCode and a SysCode. The 
        OrgCode should be the same prefix code used during the Create AWS Organization 
        step. The SysCode should be a short 2 or 3 character code identifying the 
        system the account is being created for. </p>
    <p>The system Production account name template is "OrgSysProd" where "Org" is replaced 
        with your OrgCode and "Sys" is replaced with your SysCode.
    </p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a PowerShell Terminal.</li>
        <li>CD into the LazyStackSMF folder.</li>
        <li>Execute the Prod_Account_Create.ps1 script:
             <pre><code class="language-powershell">. .\Prod_Account_Create.ps1</code></pre>
                     Here is a script run with sample inputs:
                     <pre><code class="language-powershell">
 Prod_Account_Create.ps1 - V1.0.0
 This script adds a System Production account to the Prod Organizational Unit.

            <ol type="a">
                <li>Enter the following command, replacing "OrgSys" and "githubtoken" with your values.:

        </li>        
    </ol> 

<h5>Step Summary</h5>
<p>In this step we used the Prod_Account_Create.ps1 script to create a System Production Account under 
   the Production Organization Unit. We added a Administrators group to the account with 
   AdministratorAccess permissions. We added an IAM User for the account and added that 
   user to the Administrators group. We created a AWS CLI profile allowing the Management 
   Account IAM User to manage the System Production account with the OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
   policy. Finally we installed a GitHub PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in the account so our AWS CodeBuild 
   projects (created later) can access the GitHub account.
