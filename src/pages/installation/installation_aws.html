    <h3>LazyStack AWS Software Management Framework</h4>
    <p>Follow this guide to setup a complete Software Development, Test and Deployment tool chain 
        using AWS Services and GitHub. This tool chain implements Git Feature Branch Workflow with 
        GitHub Pull Requests driving Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment of Review 
        and Production AWS Stacks. Here is a simple overview of the Feature Branch Workflow and 
        an example of a Feature (F1) developed and merged with a Pull Request into the main branch.

    <p>See the <a href="">SWF Guide</a> for more detail on using the LazyStack SWF.</p>

    <p>We break this setup of the LazyStack SMF into two parts. You can run the 
        LazyStack Tools Tutorial after completing Part 1 and then proceed with Part 2 to setup 
        a complete Development, Test and Production tool chain.</p>

    <h5>Insights:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Each Developer has their own sandbox AWS Account. This is AWS recommended best practice.</li>
        <li>Developers publish to their sandbox directly from their workstation. This leverages the AWS Toolkit 
            or AWS SAM CLI. This is the fastest way to publish and test Serverless Stacks and can result 
            in more rapid prototyping and development.
        </li>
        <li>Pull requests drive the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment of a Test Stack for 
            that PR. This provides the reviewer reviewing the pull request the ability to review 
            features using that stack as well as review the code submitted with the PR.
        </li>
        <li>Merging a pull request deletes the Test stack associated with the PR and updates the 
            production stack.
        </li>
        <li>This example illustrates the process using the Visual Studio IDE; other clients or the 
            Git CLI may be used and are discussed in the SWF Guide.
        </li>
        <li>There are three AWS accounts in this example: The developers account, the test account and the 
            production account. These accounts are created in the AWS Organization Setup.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>AWS Organization Setup Part 1</h4>
    <p>In Part 1 you create your AWS Organization with a single Organizational Unit (OrgDevOU) 
        and your first developer account in that OU. This is setup is enough to proceed with 
        the LazyStack Tutorial.
    </p>

    <h4>AWS Organization Setup Part 2</h4>
    <p>In Part 2 you implement the rest of the Software Management Framework to support collaborative 
        development and Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment of Test and Production 
        stacks. Part 2 assumes we are integrating with GitHub for software management.

    <h5>Insights:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS changed the term "Master Account" to "Management Account". The terms are equivalent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Workstations</h4>  
    <p>Management Workstation - This guide assume you have a single "Management" 
        workstation and single IAM User assigned to manage the Organization. If you 
        want to add additional Management Workstation/Users, this is easily accomplished but 
        is not part of the setup guide. Most of the setup steps in this guide are performed 
        on the Management Workstation.
    </p>
    <p>Development Workstation - This guide assumes you have one or more "Development"
        workstations. <strong>A Development Workstation can also be a Management Workstation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Each step in the guide indicates which Workstation the step should be performed on. If 
        you are setting up the organization and doing development on the same Workstation, then 
        you can ignore this distinction as your Workstation is both a Management and Development 
        Workstation.</strong>
    </p>

    <h5>Insights</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>We recommend that you use a short "organization code" (OrgCode) to prefix all organizational units 
            and  accounts and users in your AWS Organization. For instance, we recommend that you name your AWS Management Account something like "OrgMgmt" - replacing "Org" with your own "OrgCode".</li>
        <li>The defining characteristic of the Management Workstation is that it has AWS CLI Profiles 
            for an IAM User with permissions to administer all the accounts in an Organization. 
        </li>
        <li>The defining characteristic of the Development Workstation is that it has AWS CLI Profiles 
            for an IAM User with permissions to perform limited administration of a Development Account.
        </li>
        <li>When a Management Workstation is also a Development Workstation the AWS CLI Profiles
            available include both the profiles for administration and profiles for development. The 
            Workstation user must switch among those profiles as necessary based on the tasks they
            need to perform.
        </li>
    </ul>
