    <h3>Getting Started with AWS</h4>
    <p>This setup guide includes the following steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Use Existing AWS Account</li>
            <li>AWS Management Account setup - (recommended)</li>
            <li>Create AWS Organization - (optional) comprehensive SDLC environment
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Mgmt. Scripts Setup</li>
                    <li>Organization Setup</li>
                    <li>Developer Account(s) Setup</li>
                    <li>Review Account Setup</li>
                    <li>Production Account Setup</li>
                    <li>Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Setup</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>AWS Management Account Setup</h4>
    <p>Create your AWS Management Account. You can run the LazyStack tutorial 
        in the Management Account for a quick POC before proceeding with AWS Organization Setup.
    </p>
    <h5>Insights:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS changed the term "Master Account" to "Management Account". The terms are equivalent.</li>
        <li>You may use an existing AWS Account to run the LazyStack tutorial if you have AdministratorAccess 
            in that account, have installed the AWS CLI, and have used "aws configure" to create 
            a profile to access that account.</li>
        <li>If you proceed to the AWS Organization Setup step, each developer will have their own Member 
            Account in which they may run the LazyStack tutorial. Once you set up your AWS Organization,
            the Management Account should only be used for administering the AWS Organization 
            and Member Accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Workstations</h4>  
    <p>Management Workstation - This guide assume you have a single "Management" 
        workstation and single IAM User assigned to manage the Organization. If you 
        want to add additional Management Workstation/Users, this is easily accomplished but 
        is not part of the setup guide. Most of the setup in this guide is performed 
        on the Management Workstation.
    </p>
    <p>Development Workstation - This guide assumes you have one or more "Development"
        workstations. <strong>A Development Workstation can also be a Management Workstation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Each step in the guide indicates which Workstation the step should be performed on. If 
        you are setting up the organization and doing development on the same Workstation, then 
        you can ignore this distinction as your Workstation is both a Management and Development 
        Workstation.
    </p>

    <h5>Insights</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The defining characteristic of the Management Workstation is that it has AWS CLI Profiles 
            for an IAM User with permissions to administer all the accounts in an Organization. 
        </li>
        <li>The defining characteristic of the Development Workstation is that it has AWS CLI Profiles 
            for an IAM User with permissions to perform limited administration of a Development Account.
        </li>
        <li>When a Management Workstation is also A Development Workstation the the AWS CLI Profiles
            available include both the profiles for administration and profiles for development. The 
            Workstation user must switch among those profiles as necessary based on the tasks they
            need to perform.
        </li>
    </ul>
