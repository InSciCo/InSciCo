    <h4>AWS CI/CD Environment Overview</h4>

    <p>Setting up team collaboration with Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment can be 
        easily accomplished using GitHub and AWS CodeBuild. 
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous Integration automates building and testing a codebase changes prior to submitting those 
                changes for approval.</li>
            <li>Continuous Deployment automates deploying "stacks" into review or production environments.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>GitHub, Feature Branch Workflow and AWS CodeBuild</h5>
    <p>To allow this guide to be immediately practical and easily implemented, we assumes you 
        will use Git for version control, a GitHub account to host your Git repository, and a simple Feature Branch Workflow 
        with GitHub Pull Requests to manage team collaboration.
        Focusing on this popular combination allows us to offer concrete and very specific usage instructions along with
        AWS CodeBuild projects to implement CI/CD. Other work flows and Git repository services may be used but 
        each requires a different configuration.</p>

    <p>The diagrams above show how the <code class="language-bashshell">git</code> commands and GitHub 
        Pull Requests UI perform create/merge/delete on Git branches.
        The Branch Flow diagram show's the branches used in a simple Feature Branch Workflow. The local F1 branch 
        is created off of the current main branch. A shared F1 branch is created to share the new feature in 
        development. Next, the shared F1 branch is merged into the main branch and the main branch is tagged 
        with a version number. And finally, both the local and shared F1 branches are deleted.
    </p> 
    <p>Here is a more detailed narrative for this workflow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start Feature F1
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Developers solution folder is updated with latest content from main.</li>
                <li>Developer creates a local branch F1 off of remote main branch to work on a new feature.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Local Dev on F1 <br> 
            Each developer has their own AWS Account. They can use the AWS SAM CLI or the AWS Toolkit for 
            Visual Studio (Windows) IDE to publish the stack to their own account. This allows rapid 
            iteration and integration tests.
        </li>
        <li>Create PR for F1
            <ol type = "a">
                <li>Developer edits code in solution folder.</li>
                <li>Developer publishes stack to their own account directly from their Solution Folder.</li>
                <li>Developer pushes F1 as a tracked branch (-u) to GitHub shared repository.</li>
                <li>Developer creates GitHub Pull Request. GitHub generates a PULL_REQUEST_CREATED event.</li>
                <li>AWS responds to event by running GitHubReviewCreateUpdate CodeBuild project:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Branch F1 is checked out to CodeBuild Container</li>
                        <li>dotnet build --Configuration Release # Build Solution</li>
                        <li>dotnet test # Test Solution</li>
                        <li>sam deploy ... # Create/Update the 'F1' AWS stack in Review Account</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Reviewer reviews F1 code and published F1 stack.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Update PR for F1
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Developer updates code to incorporate suggestions from PR Reviewer(s).</li>

                <li>Developer pushes F1 to GitHub shared repository. GitHub generates a PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED event.</li>
