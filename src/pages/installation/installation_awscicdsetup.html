    <h4>AWS CI/CD Environment Overview</h4>

    <p>Setting up team collaboration with Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment can be 
        easily accomplished using GitHub and AWS CodeBuild. 
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous Integration automates building and testing a codebase changes prior to submitting those 
                changes for approval.</li>
            <li>Continuous Deployment automates deploying "stacks" into Test and Production accounts.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>GitHub, Feature Branch Workflow and AWS CodeBuild with Visual Studio IDE</h5>

    <p>To allow this guide to be immediately practical and easily implemented, we assume you 
        will use Git for version control, a GitHub account to host your Git shared repository, and a simple 
        Feature Branch Workflow with GitHub Pull Requests to manage team collaboration.
        Focusing on this popular combination allows us to offer concrete and very specific usage instructions 
        along with AWS CodeBuild projects to implement CI/CD. Other work flows and Git repository services 
        may be used but each requires a different configuration. The diagram below illustrates this flow 
        with the Visual Studio IDE.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="">SWF Guide</a> for more detail on using the LazyStack SWF.</p>

    <h5>GitHub, Feature Branch Workflow and CodeBuild with detailed Git Commands</h5>
    <p>The diagrams below illustrates the detailed <code class="language-bashshell">git</code> commands and GitHub 
        Pull Requests UI perform create/merge/delete on Git branches. These commands are hidden from the 
        developer when using the Visual Studio IDE and GitHub PR Merge process. You will need these commands 
        if you are working in the .NET CLI with no IDE.

    <p>Here is a more detailed narrative for this workflow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start Feature F1
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Developers solution folder is updated with latest content from main.</li>
                <li>Developer creates a local branch F1 off of remote main branch to work on a new feature.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Local Dev on F1 <br> 
            Each developer has their own AWS Account. They can use the AWS SAM CLI or the AWS Toolkit for 
            Visual Studio (Windows) IDE to publish the stack to their own account. This allows rapid 
            iteration and integration tests in a completely isolated "sandbox".
        </li>
        <li>Create PR for F1
            <ol type = "a">
                <li>Developer edits code in solution folder.</li>
                <li>Developer publishes stack to their own account directly from their Solution Folder.</li>
                <li>Developer pushes F1 as a tracked branch (-u) to GitHub shared repository.</li>
                <li>Developer creates GitHub Pull Request. GitHub generates a PULL_REQUEST_CREATED event.</li>
