     <h5>Step Summary</h5>
     <p>In this step we used the CreateProdAccount.ps1 script to create a Production Account under 
        the Production Organization Unit. We added a Administrators group to the account with 
        AdministratorAccess permissions. We added an IAM User for the account and added that 
        user to the Administrators group. We created a AWS CLI profile allowing the Management 
        Account IAM User to manage the Prod account with the OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
        policy.
