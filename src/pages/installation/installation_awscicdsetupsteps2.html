        <dt>Prerequisites:</dt>
        <dd>- Prod Account Setup complete</dd>
        <dd>- A GitHub Repository you want to use</dd>

    <p>This step assumes you have created an GitHub application repository and now
        want to publish production stacks from that repository. If you
        don't have a repository yet, no worries - you can come back to this step later on.
    </p>

    <p>You repeat this step for each GitHub repository you want to use in your SMF.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>If you do not already have a CodeBuild GitHub Connection for the Prod Account, follow these steps to create
            one:

                <li>Log into the AWS OrgProd account using the OrgProd IAM User credentials.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?"
                        {{>newtab}}>CodeBuild</a> Console</li>
                <li>Select Settings &rightarrow; Connections in navigation pane. The Developer Tools > Connections page
