    <h3>Configure LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF)</h4>

        <p>The LazyStack SMF provides an end-to-end Software Management Framework integrating AWS Services, GitHub and the 
            LazyStack developer tools. Take a close look at the diagram below, we will be following the SMF Setup Steps 1 through 
            3 to create your first AWS Organization, with one system (called Tut). Later, in the LazyStack SMF Tutorial, you use 
            step 4 to add serverless application stacks to the Tut system. After completing the tutorial you add additional 
            Systems and Stacks when you need them. Keep in mind that AWS has a default limit of 4 accounts per organization, you 
            can ask them to increase this limit as necessary.

            <ul >
                <li>Step 1 - Create AWS Organization
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.1 Configure Management Workstation</li>
                        <li>1.2 Create AWS Management Account </li>
                        <li>1.3 Create AWS Organization</li>
                        <li>1.4 Create GitHub Account(s) - one may be all you need but multiple GitHub Accounts may be used</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Step 2 - Add Developer(s)
                    <ul>
                        <li>2.1 Create Developer AWS Account (each developer has their own "sandbox" account)</li>
                        <li>2.2 Configure Developer's Workstation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Step 3 - Create System(s)
                    <ul>
                        <li>We define a System as a collection of AWS Resources managed together (serverless stacks are AWS Resources). Systems are used to segregate unrelated applications; for example 
                            different line-of-business, product or customer. System's are managed in two AWS Accounts: Test and Production.
                        </li>
                        <li>3.1 Create AWS Test Account for System</li>
                        <li>3.2 Create AWS Production Account for System</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Step 4 - Create Stack(s)<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serverless Stacks are a collection of resources deployed together as a unit. Each Serverless Stack is associated with a single GitHub Repository. 
                            A System may contain one or more Serverless Stacks.
                        </li>
                        <li>4.1 Create GitHub Repository</li>
                        <li>4.2 Configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for System Test Account</li>
                        <li>4.3 Configure Continuous Deployment for System Production Account</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
