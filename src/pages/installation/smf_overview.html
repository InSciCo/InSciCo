    <h3>Configure LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF)</h4>

        <p>The LazyStack SMF provides an end-to-end Software Management Framework integrating AWS Services, GitHub Services, and
            LazyStack developer tools. Take a close look at the diagram below, we will be following the SMF Setup Steps create 
            your first Organization consisting of an integrated AWS Organization and GitHub Organization.

            <h4>Configuring your Organization</h4>
            <p>Follow these steps to prepare the SMF for your team to start performing the LazyStack Tutorials.

            <ul >
                <li>Step 1 - Create Organization
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.1 Create GitHub Organization and Configure Management Workstation (
                        You may use an existing GitHub Organization)</li>
                        <li>1.2 Create AWS Management Account </li>
                        <li>1.3 Create AWS Organization</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Step 2 - Add Developer(s)
                    <ul>
                        <li>2.1 Create Developer AWS Account (each developer has their own "sandbox" account)</li>
                        <li>2.2 Configure Developer's Workstation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Step 3 - Create System(s)
                    <ul>
                        <li>We define a System as a collection of AWS Resources managed together (serverless stacks are AWS Resources). Systems are used to segregate unrelated applications; for example 
                            different line-of-business, product or customer. System's are managed in two AWS Accounts: Test and Production. 
                            We will start by creating a System called "Tutorial" that will be used to host stacks created by developers 
                            performing the LazyStack Tools Tutorial and SMF Tutorial.
                        </li>
                        <li>3.1 Create AWS Test Account for System</li>
                        <li>3.2 Create AWS Production Account for System</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Step 4 - Configure Repo(s)<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each Serverless Stack is associated with a single GitHub Repository. A System may be associated with one or 
                            more repositories in the same GitHub Account; so each System may have multiple stacks. We assume you 
                            have a GitHub Organization and one or more GitHub Accounts that are part of that Organization; each
                            developer has their own GitHub Account and that account is a member of the GitHub Organization. 
                            To allow each developer to perform the SMF Tutorial, we suggest you create a new GitHub repository,
                            in your GitHub Organization, that the developer will use in the SMF tutorial. 
                        </li>
                        <li>4.1 Create GitHub Repository</li>
                        <li>4.2 Configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for System Test Account</li>
                        <li>4.3 Configure Continuous Deployment for System Production Account</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
