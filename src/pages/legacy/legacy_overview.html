    <h3>Legacy Projects Overview</h4>

        <p>LazyStack SMF is now depreciated in favor of the new LazyStack SaaS project and use of AWS ControlTower.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Use LazyStackSMF to setup an AWS Organization supporting multiple developers collaborating through GitHub with GitHub Pull Requests. Provide application test accounts supporting Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Provide application production accounts with Continuous Deployment. The workstation on which this setup is run is called the "Management Workstation" and will be configured with a number of LazyStack  automation scripts to make creating and managing your AWS Organization a snap. A Development  Workstation can also be a Management Workstation.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Setting up secure AWS Organizations and accounts correctly the first time can be tricky. LazyStack SMF sets up AWS services and security infrastructure according to AWS best practices. 
        </p>
        <p>LazyStack SMF has extensive documentation that serves as a “blueprint” for a development shop wanting to get started with AWS/.NET serverless application development. The LazyStack SMF is comprised of PowerShell management scripts and CloudFormation templates that automate everything that can be automated in setting up and managing a comprehensive serverless stack development pipeline using AWS Services and GitHub. LazyStack SMF also works seamlessly with our LazyStack Model Driven Development (MDD) tool.
        </p>
        <p>The LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF) ensures your collaborative development process, test process, and production 
            deployments are managed efficiently and securely.
