    <h3>LzUpdateDevCreds Script</h3>
    <p>The LzUpdateDevCreds.ps1 PowerShell script is run on the Management Workstation to 
        update a Developer's AWS Sandbox Account IAMUserCredsPolicy. This script is usually 
        run after you have created or updated a local copy of IAMUserCredsPolicy.json in the 
        LazyStackSettings folder. To create a local copy of the IAMUserCredsPolicy.json, just 
        copy from LazyStackSMF\IAMUserCredsPolicy.json.
    </p>

    <h5>IAMUserCredsPolicy.json</h5>
    <p>This policy grants the developer those permissions typically required to publish 
        Serverless Stacks to their AWS Sandbox Account. Use the LzUpdateDevCreds.ps1  
        script to update the policy for an existing developer's account when you make changes
        to the local IAMUserCredsPolicy.json document.
    </p>
    <p>The IAMUserCredsPolicy.json document applies the principle of least privileges to 
        the developer account. Since the developer account is a "sandbox", the developer is 
        allowed a wide range of privileges with restrictions primarily being applied to 
        IAM permissions. It's a good idea to review the IAMUserCredsPolicy.json document and 
        understand what permissions are being provided to each developer account.
    </p>
