    <h3>Software Management Framework</h3>
    <p>LazyStack SMF is now depreciated in favor of the new LazyStack SaaS project and use of AWS ControlTower. However, LazyStack SMF is still a good tool for parties interested in the 'nuts and bolts' of using the AWS CLI to manipulate AWS Accounts and build a CI/CD toolchain using GitHub and AWS. We have retained this documentation for your review but recommend the new open-source LazyStack SaaS platform for new implementations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Use LazyStackSMF to setup an AWS Organization supporting multiple developers collaborating through GitHub with
        GitHub Pull Requests. Provide application test accounts supporting Continuous Integration and Continuous
        Deployment. Provide application production accounts with Continuous Deployment. The workstation on which this
        setup is run is called the "Management Workstation" and will be configured with a number of LazyStack automation
        scripts to make creating and managing your AWS Organization a snap. A Development Workstation can also be a
        Management Workstation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Setting up secure AWS Organizations and accounts correctly the first time can be tricky. LazyStack SMF sets up
        AWS services and security infrastructure according to AWS best practices. 
    </p>
    <p>LazyStack SMF has extensive documentation that serves as a “blueprint” for a development shop wanting to get
        started with AWS/.NET serverless application development. The LazyStack SMF is comprised of PowerShell
        management scripts and CloudFormation templates that automate everything that can be automated in setting up and
        managing a comprehensive serverless stack development pipeline using AWS Services and GitHub. LazyStack SMF also
        works seamlessly with our LazyStack Model Driven Development (MDD) tool.
    </p>
    <p>The LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF) ensures your collaborative development process, test process,
        and production
        deployments are managed efficiently and securely.
    </p>

    <p>The LazyStack SMF provides an end-to-end Software Management Framework integrating AWS Services, GitHub and the
        LazyStack developer tools. In the Install process, the following AWS Organization structure was created.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>The LazyStackSMF provides a collaborative workflow based on "Feature Branch Development using GitHub Pull
        Requests".</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSMFSetup10.svg" width="100%">
    <p></p>
    <p>A high-level "AWS" view of this organization looks like this:</p>

    <p> </p>
    <p>In the diagram above, GitHub integration is shown and GitHub Pull Requests are used to coordinate the
        review and approval of features coded by a developer. In this diagram we see:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers publish from their workstation directly to their AWS "sandbox" Account</li>
        <li>Pull Request creation or update publish PR Stacks in the Test Account. This is accomplished using
            AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks.
        </li>
        <li>Pull Request Merges publish Prod Stack in the Production Account. This is also accomplished
            using AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>An abstract view of the steps in the collaborative development process looks like this:

    <h5>PR Stack Review</h5>
    <p> A PR Stack is named after the PR branch that created it. This means there can be many PR Stacks deployed in the
        System Test
        account at the same time. To review a Pull Request Stack, you need to know how to connect to it. With that in
        mind,
        the CI/CD pipeline that creates the PR Stack also generates and adds a AwsSettings.json file to the PR branch in
        the repository.
        This file is usually found at Stacks/Test/AwsSettings.json. For more information on AwsSettings.json file,
        click <a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html">here </a>. The LazyStack Tutorial covers the use of
        AwsSettings.json
        files, see <a href="/tutorial/tutorial_vswin_petstoretest.html">Configure PetStoreTests Project</a>.
