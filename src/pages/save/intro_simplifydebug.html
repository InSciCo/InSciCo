    <h3>Making Serverless Easy to Debug</h3>
    <p>When we code our applications we want to be able to easily debug both the client and services code;
        <strong>at
            the same time</strong>! Both the SAM CLI and AWS Visual Studio Toolkit provide some minimalist support for
        running lambda&rsquo;s locally; but we wanted an easier to use and more powerful debugging solution for
        developing
        complex services. It turns out the tools we needed to do that are available for .NET!</p>
    <p>Because we implement access to our application logic in AspNetCore.ControllerBase classes we can use those
        controllers in both lambda functions and a local WebApi Server.</p>
    <p>Here is what we want to accomplish on the developer&rsquo;s workstation.</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackDualHeadOverview.svg"/>
    
    <p>From our desktop we want to be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Run a Local WebAPI that presents the same API to the Application Client that our SAM stack presents and
                allow
                that local WebAPI implementation to access the same resources (ex: DynamoDB and S3) as those used by the
                SAM
                stack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Debug the client application - for instance using Visual Studio. The client calls Cognito to authenticate
                and
                authorize. Then makes calls to the local WebAPI Server.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Debug the application controllers code - for instance using Visual Studio. Calls initiated in the client
                can
                be traced through the controllers code when received by the local WebAPI server. The controllers code
                use
                the
                developer&rsquo;s local AWS credentials to access resources like DynamoDB and S3 in AWS but can access
                the
                request headers to gather information on the client user identity. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reuse the application controllers code, <strong>without change</strong>, in both the SAM stack and Local
                WebAPI server implementations.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One important difference between the WebAPI server and the Lambda(s) in your Serverless Stack is that routes
        in
        your OpenAPI may, and often should, point to different Lambda functions. AWS limits the number of API Gateway
        routes that may reference a single Lambda. </p>
    <p>In contrast, the local WebAPI server hosts ALL of the API routes. For local debugging, having all your routes
        serviced by the same local server is a feature, not a limitation. There are times when this distinction must
        be
        considered, for example, when you want to debug code where multiple instances of a lambda function in the
        cloud
        accessing the same database record at the same time - this is not possible to test with a local WebAPI as
        there
        is
        only one &ldquo;instance&rdquo; of the lambda function. </p>
