    <h3>LazyStack Business Stakeholder Overview</h3>
<p> LazyStack's mission is to enable technical entrepreneurs to quickly field mobile and web applications leveraging 
    scalable cloud-based resources at the lowest initial cost, without sacrificing security, scalability or features.
    LazyStack is a collection of technical best-practices, templates, configuration scrips and development tools. These 
    technical details are covered extensively on this site. Before diving into that technical material, here are the 
    high level value propositions of LazyStack.

<p>The LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF) ensures your collaborative development process, test process, and production 
    deployments are managed efficiently and securely. The LazyStack Model Driven Development (MDD) development tools 
    reduce development costs, improve development agility, and decrease time to market for your products.
</p>

<h3>Why did we build LazyStack?</h3>
<p>Technical Entrepreneurs generally have more ideas than capital. LazyStack makes it easier to bring a fully
    functional application stack to market at a very low development and operational cost so more of these ideas
    can be market tested until viable monetization is demonstrable. The recent &ldquo;Fail Fast&rdquo; mantra 
    does have some merit, but only if your application attempt doesn&rsquo;t fail in the technical sense. 
    LazyStack generates commercial grade production stacks that both support rapid prototype development and are 
    robust enough for production apps. Generated code truly lets us have our cake and eat it too. </p>

<p>A Technical Entrepreneur may be a single person or a team where the aggregate skill-sets include product
    definition, product development, product testing, product marketing/sales and product support. We leave
    general
    business management and capital raise out of this definition because it is often necessary to demonstrate an
    app
    with modest market acceptance before you can raise capital to scale up. </p>
<p>We would also observe that even in larger organizations it is sometimes a &ldquo;skunk works&rdquo; team that
    fits our definition of Technical Entrepreneur. </p>

<p> So, why the name: LazyStack? Hlade's Law states: "If you have a difficult task, give it to a lazy person; they will find an 
    easier way to do it". Code generation is the easy way to accomplish robust stack deployment. 
    Frankly, we wouldn't want to handwrite any of this code ever again and we can't imagine you'd want to either.</p>
