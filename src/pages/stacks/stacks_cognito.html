    <h3>Cognito</h3>
    <p>"Amazon Cognito handles user authentication and authorization for your web and mobile apps. 
        With user pools, you can easily and securely add sign-up and sign-in functionality to your 
        apps. With identity pools (federated identities), your apps can get temporary credentials 
        that grant users access to specific AWS resources, whether the users are anonymous or are 
        signed in." <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/?id=docs_gateway"{{>newtab}}>AWS Cognito</a></p>
    
    <p>Does Cognito live up to this billing? Well yes, but there is a steep learning curve where you need to understand
        how AWS Cognito resources interact with other AWS resources and it can be a challenge to understand
        the breadth of configuration and process options available in AWS Cognito. LazyStack eliminates this painful learning 
        curve by generating the necessary AWS resource specifications in the serverless.template for you.
    </p>
    
    <h4>HttpApiSecure</h4>
    <p>When you use the predefined secure ApiGateway HttpApiSecure, LazyStack creates the following resource in the 
        serverless.template SAM specification:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS::Serverless::HttpApi</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::UserPool</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>ApiSecure</h4>
    <p>When you use the predefined secure ApiGateway ApiSecure, LazyStack creates the following resources in the 
        serverless.template SAM specification:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS::Serverless::Api</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::UserPool</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool</li>
        <li>AWS::Cognito::IdentityPoolRoleAttachment</li>
        <li>AWS::IAM::Role</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>User Pool</h4>
    <p>The AWS::Cognito::UserPool resource is a user directory. It is used to authenticate users and often referred to as
        an Authentication Provider. You can use UserPool Federation to allow users to authenticate from other
        authentication providers like Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, Sign in with Apple, and SAML providers.
        The current LazyStackAuth library supports only Cognito sign-in, but support for using Cognito User Pool
        federation with other authentication providers like Facebook and Google is planned. 
    </p>
    <h4>Identity Pool</h4>
    <p>The AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool is a federated identity manager. When used, it also enables additional services
        we care about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognito Sync</strong> - syncing data across user devices</li>
        <li><strong>Secure AWS::Serverless::Api</strong> - sign HttpRequests with Signature Version 4 process</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cognito Configuration Strategy</h4>
    <p>The hardest challenge of Cognito is digging through tons of documentation and getting everything configured 
        properly. LazyStack configures your application stack with what we intend to be a <em>future-proof</em> strategy. 
        For instance, it is possible to implement an application stack using only Cognito User Pools if you are willing 
        to forgo access to the more secure AwsVer4 signing of HttpRequests. By using both User Pools and Identity Pools, 
        you can use any of the ApiGateway models. Since LazyStack has already set up the AWS Resources and provided the 
        LazyStackAuth library, there isn't any compelling reason to take the short cut of using only Cognito User Pools, 
        so IdentityPools are defined for both ApiSecure and HttpApiSecure ApiGateways.
