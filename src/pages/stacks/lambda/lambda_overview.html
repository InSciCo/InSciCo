    <h3>Lambda Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Lambda functions are implemented as C# projects leveraging the AWS AspNetCoreServer class. This
        class allows Lambda Functions to act like standard .NET Core WepApi services where calls from
        an AWS ApiGateway are directed to AspNet Controller methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        LazyStack calls the NSwag C# generator to generate C# AspNet Controller projects from the
        applications OpenApi specification. LazyStack also updates Lambda Project references to 
        reference the appropriate Controller projects.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each OpenApi <strong>tag</strong> generates:
            <ul>
                <li>Controller project.</li>
                <li>Lambda Function project referencing the Controller project.</li>
                <li>AWS::Serverless::Function resource in the serverless.template file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each OpenApi <strong>route</strong> (Path object + Operation object) is associated with a tag and generates:
            <ul>
                <li>Lambda Function Event for the tag's AWS::Serverless::Function resource.</li>
                <li>Controller class method for handling the Lambda Function Event.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each OpenApi component (schema) generates a class definition in the Schema project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>If you are not familiar with OpenApi and in particular how OpenApi tags are specified, you might review the
            <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/"{{>newtab}}>OpenApi Specification</a>. However, the examples in this 
            documentation and the Tutorial make their use clear. The PetStore OpenApi specification used throughout 
            our documentation and tutorial is similar to the OpenApi PetStore specification example.
        </em></p>
    
    <p>LazyStack Lambda Functions are C# projects. When you publish your serverless stack, these projects
        are packaged up and copied into S3 storage. When a Lambda Function is called, AWS provisions an execution
        container using the appropriate packaged project from S3.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>In the PetStore OpenApi example, we have four OpenApi tags: order, orderSecure, pet and petSecure. LazyStack will generate/update
        the following projects:</p>
