    <h3>Test Projects</h3>
    <p>When developing test suites for an application stack we reference the controller project(s) directly
        from our test project so each use-case test becomes a simple sequence of calls against controller methods.
        We also use dependency injection to ensure we can swap out real AWS services for mock services when necessary.
