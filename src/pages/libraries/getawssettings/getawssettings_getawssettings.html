    <h4>LazyStackGetAwsSettings App</h4>
    <p>The LazyStackGetAwsSettings console app project is a tool that uses AWS CloudFormation to query the contents 
        of a published AWS Stack and then generate a json file containing the information necessary 
        for your client to connect to and use Cognito Authentication Provider provisioned in that stack.
    </p>
    <p>This utility produces AwsSettings.json files as those produced by the LazyStack Visual Studio 
        extension and CLI tools.</p>
    <p>This tool is useful if you are using the LazyStackAuth library but not using the LazyStack Generator to 
        generate your stacks.
    </p>
