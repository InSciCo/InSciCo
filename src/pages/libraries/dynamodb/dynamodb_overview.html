    <h3>LazyStackDynamoDBRepo Overview</h3>
    <p>LazyStack includes the LazyStackDynamoDBRepo project template. This project library provides 
        a generalized model for CRUDL operations on the AWS DynamoDB service. This library is used 
        in the LazyStack Tutorial. Since LazyStackDynamoDBRepo is a bit of a mouthful, we will 
        refer to the library as the DynamoDBRepo in this documentation section.
    </p>
    <p>We often use the AWS DynamoDB NoSQL database in simple stacks because it provides 
        encryption-at-rest, scalability, doesn’t require a VPC, and is competitively priced even at scale. However, 
        using a NoSQL database requires a somewhat different skill-set than is required for SQL databases.</p>
     <p>We always start our application design with the development of a data model - often expressed 
         as an Entity Relationship (“ER”) model.</p>  
         
    <p>Creating a NoSQL database from an ER model is much more involved that creating a SQL database from 
        that same model. We will 
    </p>
    <p>In this section we will discuss a very generic approach to translating an ER model into 
        data stored in a DynamoDB table and how to query against that table with the DynamoDBRepo library.
