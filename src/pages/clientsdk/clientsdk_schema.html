    <h3>PetStoreSchema project</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Interface Schema Classes generated by NSwag.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>LazyStack uses NSwag to generate client and server side libraries. NSwag generates a single 
        file with the client api classes and schema type classes in it. LazyStack 
        separates these classes and places the api classes in the ClientSDK and the schema type 
        classes in the Schema project. Both the client and server reference the schema project; this 
        guarantees the client and server always use the same schema type definition and promote 
        code reuse through libraries used in client and server.
    </p>
    <p>It is not unusual for the client and/or server to have their own additional schema 
        definitions. These client specific and server specific schema types should not be included in 
        the Schema project as they are not part of the OpenApi specification.
