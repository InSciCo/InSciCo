    <h3>AWS Settings</h3>
    <p>Client applications need configuration information to initialize their communication 
        with your AWS Stack. This is provided by an LazyStack generated AwsSettings.json file.

  <li>None 
    <p>The ApiGateway allows any valid HttpRequest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>JWT
    <p>The ApiGateway requires the HttpRequest Authorization Header contain a valid 
      Jason Web Token issued by Cognito.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>AwsSignatureVersion4
    <p>The ApiGateway requires the HttpRequest Authorization Header contain a 
      computed signature of the HttpRequest. This means every HttpRequest has a 
      unique signature computed on the client and then computed again by the 
      ApiGateway. The results must match for the HttpRequest to be processed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You may generate the AwsSettings.json file for the Development environment using the LazyStack 
    Visual Studio IDE extension command: "Tools -> LazyStack - Generate Dev_AwsSettings.json". This 
    file is generated into the Solution's root folder and is visible in the Solution Explorer "Solution Items" 
    folder. 
</p>
<p>The LazyStack AWS Settings Generator generates the AwsSettings file using your default AWS profile and
    making calls against AWS CloudFormation to retrieve published stack information. It also uses 
    the Solution's serverless.template file to get the SecurityLevel of each ApiGateway.
</p>
<p>To generate an AwsSettings file for another stack, say your production stack, switch to the appropriate 
    AWS profile and  use the NET CLI command:
