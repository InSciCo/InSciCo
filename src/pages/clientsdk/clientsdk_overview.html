    <h3>ClientSDK Overview</h3>
    <p>LazyStack generates the application {appName}ClientSDK library project and the {appName}Schema library project. You 
        use these libraries, along with the LazyStackAuth library, in your client application to make secure calls 
        against your AWS Application Stack. Consider the following diagram of the PetStore application.

    <ul>
        <li><a  href="/libraries/lazystackauth/lazystackauth_lazystackauth.html">LazyStackAuth</a>
            <p>The AWS Cognito Authentication libraries are rather involved and require a substantial time investment
                to master. They are also 100% AWS specific and do not attempt to present a generalized process. On the 
                other hand, these Cognito libraries are robust and implement a well known challenge/response pattern. The 
                LazyStackAuth library wraps the AWS Cognito authentication libraries with a fully generalized 
                challenge/response model that provides for the implementation of other authentication providers or 
                for extensions to the the Cognito authentication process.
            </p>
            <p>The LazyStackAuth project is available as a NuGet package, a LazyStack template project and 
                as a MIT licensed source project in the LazyStackLibs GitHub repository. 
            It provides a generalized challenge/response based user management library that uses the 
            Amazon.Extension.CognitoAuthentication library to make calls against the 
            Cognito authentication service. Note that it also calls AWS STS to get temporary credentials if necessary.</p>
            
            <p>The LazyStackAuth authentication classes require configuration to reach the AWS Application Stack. This 
                configuration is provided in the <a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html">AwsSettings.json</a>
                 file described below. The "AwsSettings.json" file is usually included as an embedded resource in 
                 the client app and read into the applications IConfiguration appConfig. This appConfig is passed 
                 into the LazyStackAuth AuthProcess class constructor so that AuthProcess has the necessary 
                 information to connect to your AWS Application Stack.
            </p>

            <p>After authenticating against Cognito, your client application uses the LazyStackAuth 
                <a  href="/libraries/lazystackauth/lazystackauth_lzhttpclient.html">LzHttpClient</a> class
                to make secure calls against AWS ApiGateways. This class uses configuration information 
                from AwsSettings.json along with configuration information in the "MethodMap.json" configuration 
                file provided in the ClientSDK. 
            </p>
            <p>The "MethodMap.json" file is an embedded resource in the ClientSDK. Like "AwsSettings.json", this resource 
                is generally loaded into the applications IConfiguration appConfig. This appConfig reference is passed 
                into the LzHttpClient constructor. The LazyStack generated file "MethodMap.json" contains a map of methods to 
                ApiGateways that LzHttpClient uses to discover which ApiGateway services each method.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><a  href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_clientsdk.html">PetStoreClientSDK</a>
            <p>The PetStoreClientSDK is comprised of two files. The ClientSDK library class (PetStore.cs) generated by NSwag and the 
                MethodMap.json file generated by LazyStack. PetStore.cs contains methods that make calls to your 
                ApiGateway endpoints. The PetStore class constructor is passed a reference to an instance of 
                the <a  href="/libraries/lazystackauth/lazystackauth_lzhttpclient.html">LzHttpClient</a> class so that calls against 
                the PetStore.cs class can be securely made against one or more AWS ApiGateways.
        </p>
        <p>Note:<i>There are a variety of OpenApi &RightArrow; C# code generators available. Some of these offer 
            substantially more features than the current version of NSwag. However, NSwag is native C#, very robust 
            and under active development so we have chosen to use it.</i>
        </p>

        <li> <a  href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_schema.html">PetStoreSchema</a>
            <p>The PetStoreSchema project is a library of data schema types that are used to transport 
                data among the client and server. This library is used on both the client and server. LazyStack 
            uses NSwag to generate this library. </li>

            <p>Note:<i>Users familiar with NSwag know that NSWag generates separate schema classes for the client 
                and server code. LazyStack extracts the Schema class from the NSwag generated client library into a 
                single separate project for use in both client and server code. This makes writing dependent libraries 
                that can be references by both client and server code simple.</i></p>
        </li>

        <li> <a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html">AwsSettings</a>
            <p>The AwsSettings.json file contains the configuration values necessary to configure the client 
                to use the AWS application stack. It is normally an embedded resource in the client application. 
                LazyStack generates the AwsSettings.json file for you. There are separate versions of the AwsSettings.json 
                file for each stack environment. For instance you might have separate stacks for Dev, Test and Prod. Each 
                of these will have their own AwsSettings.json file. See the <a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html">
                    AwsSettings</a> for instructions on how to generate AwsSettings.json files.
