    <h3>Software Management Framework</h3>
    <p>The LazyStack SMF provides an end-to-end Software Management Framework integrating AWS Services, GitHub and the LazyStack developer tools. In the Install process, the following process was followed to configure an AWS Organization.</p>

    <p>An abstract view of the organizational hierarchy is presented below. This abstraction includes an organization 
        which manages one or more systems and each of those systems contains one or more serverless stacks. In addition,
        a collaborative development workflow around "features" is included.</p>

    <p>A high-level view of a concrete implementation of this organization looks like this:</p>

    <p>In the diagram above, GitHub integration is shown and GitHub Pull Requests are used to coordinate the 
        review and approval of features coded by a developer. In this diagram we see:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers publish from their workstation directly to their AWS "sandbox" Account</li>
        <li>Pull Requests publish PR Stacks in the Test Account. This is accomplished using 
            AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks. More on this follows.
        </li>
        <li>PUll Requests publish Prod Stack in the Production Account. This is also accomplished 
            using AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks. More on this follows.
        </li>
    </ul>
