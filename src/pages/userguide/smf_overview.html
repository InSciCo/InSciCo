    <ul>
        <li>Developers publish from their workstation directly to their AWS "sandbox" Account</li>
        <li>Pull Request creation or update publish PR Stacks in the Test Account. This is accomplished using 
            AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks.
        </li>
        <li>Pull Request Merges publish Prod Stack in the Production Account. This is also accomplished 
            using AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>An abstract view of the steps in the collaborative development process looks like this:
