    <h3>Software Management Framework</h3>
    <p>The LazyStack SMF provides an end-to-end Software Management Framework integrating AWS Services, GitHub and the LazyStack developer tools. In the Install process, the following AWS Organization structure was created.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>The LazyStackSMF provides a collaborative workflow based on "Feature Branch Development using GitHub Pull Requests".</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSMFSetup10.svg" width="100%">

    <p>A high-level "AWS" view of this organization looks like this:</p>

    <p> </p>
    <p>In the diagram above, GitHub integration is shown and GitHub Pull Requests are used to coordinate the 
        review and approval of features coded by a developer. In this diagram we see:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers publish from their workstation directly to their AWS "sandbox" Account</li>
        <li>Pull Request creation or update publish PR Stacks in the Test Account. This is accomplished using 
            AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks.
        </li>
        <li>Pull Request Merges publish Prod Stack in the Production Account. This is also accomplished 
            using AWS CodeBuild projects connected to GitHub WebHooks.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>An abstract view of the steps in the collaborative development process looks like this:

    <h5>PR Stack Review</h5>
    <p> A PR Stack is named after the PR branch that created it. This means there can be many PR Stacks deployed in the System Test 
        account at the same time.  To review a Pull Request Stack, you need to know how to connect to it. With that in mind, 
        the CI/CD pipeline that creates the PR Stack also generates and adds a AwsSettings.json file to the PR branch in the repository. 
        This file is usually found at Stacks/Test/AwsSettings.json. For more information on AwsSettings.json file, 
        click <a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html">here </a>. The LazyStack Tutorial covers the use of AwsSettings.json 
        files, see <a href="/tutorial/tutorial_vswin_petstoretest.html">Configure PetStoreTests Project</a>.
