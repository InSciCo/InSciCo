    <h3>AWS CLI Named Profiles</h3>

    <p>The AWS tools use local AWS profiles to authenticate calls from a workstation to the AWS Cloud. An 
        AWS profile contains an AccessKeyID and a SecretKey. By selected a named profile, you are instructing 
        an AWS tool to use that AccessKey pair to authenticate with a specific AWS Cloud Account. Consider
        the named profiles in the previous section's diagram:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Management Workstation
            <ul>
                <li>OrgMgmt - account from which AWS Organization is managed. AdministratorAccess.</li>
                <li>OrgDevJoeAccess - Allows OrgMgmt account to assume administrator role in OrgDevJoe Account</li>
                <li>OrgSysTestAccess - Allows OrgMgmt account to assume administrator role in OrgSysTest Account</li>
                <li>OrgSysProdAccess - Allows OrgMgmt account to assume administrator role in OrgSysProd Account</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Joe's Development Workstation
            <ul>
                <li>OrgDevJoe - Provides PowerUser Access and select IAM permissions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>OrgSysTest Workstation
            <ul>
                <li>OrgSysTest - AdministratorAccess</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>OrgSysProd Workstation
            <ul>
                <li>OrgSysProd - AdministratorAccess</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>AWS allows you to create a "default" profile that will be used if you don't supply a specific profile 
        name when executing an AWS tool. We strongly recommend that you never use a default profile on the 
        Management Workstation. We also recommend you only use a default profile on a Developer's Workstation 
        when they will only ever be working against a single AWS Account.
    </p>

    <h5>AWS IAM Users</h5>
    <p>Every AWS Account has a root user. That root user is associated with a email address that is unique 
        among AWS Accounts - you can't use the same email address for more than one account. You sign into 
        the root user account using at least that email address and a password. Signing into an account 
        using the root user credentials should only be done for a limited number of account management 
        reasons. All other access should be performed through a IAM User login.
    </p>
    <p>We create a single IAM User for each AWS Account created in the AWS Organization. See the diagram 
        below:
