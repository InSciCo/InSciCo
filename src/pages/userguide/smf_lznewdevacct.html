    <h3>LzNewDevAccount Script</h3>
    <p>The LzNewDevAcct.ps1 PowerShell script is run on the Management Workstation to create 
        a new Developer AWS Sandbox Account belonging  to your AWS organization and moves 
        this account into the DevOU Organizational Unit. The AWS Account will have a IAM 
        Policy Group called  Developers. The Developers Group will 
        have two policies: PowerUsersAccess and  IAMUserCredsPolicy. PowerUsersAccess is an 
        AWS Management Policy. IAMUserCredsPolicy is a customer managed IAM Policy created by 
        this script from the provided LazyStackSMF\IAMUserCredsPolicy.json file or, if 
        available, a IAMUserCredsPolicy.json file in your LazyStackSettings folder.
    </p>
    
    <h5>IAMUserCredsPolicy.json</h5>
    <p>This policy grants the developer those permissions typically required to publish 
        Serverless Stacks to their Sandbox Account. If you need to provide more permissions than 
        this policy provides you can create a local version of the file in the LazyStackSettings 
        folder. The script looks for a local version of the file before using the one in the 
        LazyStackSMF folder. Use the <a href="/userguide/smf_lzupdatedevcreds.html">LzUpdateDevCreds.ps1</a>  
        script to update the policy for an existing developer's account.
    </p>

    <h5>Running the LzNewDevAcct Script</h5>
    <p>Each AWS Account needs a unique email address or alias. Have this handy before you run the script.</p>

        <li>Open a PowerShell terminal</li>
        <br>
        <li>CD into your LazyStackSettings folder.</li>
