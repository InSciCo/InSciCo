    <h3>Developer Workflow</h3>
    <p>An abstract view of the steps in the collaborative development process looks like this:

    <h5>Important: Reviewing a PR Stack</h5>
    <p>To review a Pull Request Stack, you need to know how to connect to it. With that in mind, the CI/CD pipeline that creates 
        the PR Stack also generates and adds a AwsSettings.json file to the PR branch in the repository. This file is usually found 
        at Stacks/Test/AwsSettings.json. For more information on AwsSettings.json file, click <a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html">here
        </a>. The LazyStack Tutorial covers the use of AwsSettings.json files, see <a href="/tutorial/tutorial_vswin_petstoretest.html">Configure PetStoreTests Project</a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Collaborative Process Implementation</h5>
    <p>A concrete implementation of the collaborative development process using Visual Studio IDE integration with GitHub looks like this:</p>

    <p>In the diagram above, developers publish serverless stacks to their own AWS Account for rapid prototyping and testing,
        but have no direct connection to a Test or Production account. Instead, each serverless stack has its own GitHub 
        repository and updates to serverless stacks in the Test and Production accounts are based on Pull Requests in that 
        GitHub repository; more on that later.
    </p>

    <p>The developer is free to code serverless stack features and publish that stack in their AWS Account frequently and 
        without fear they will affect anyone else on the team. This freedom is key to rapid prototyping and development.
        AWS provides three tools for publishing serverless stacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS CLI using CloudFormation commands</li>
        <li>AWS SAM CLI</li>
        <li>AWS Visual Studio IDE Extension</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We focus on and recommend using the AWS SAM CLI for command line work and in shell scripts. We also recommend 
        using the AWS Visual Studio IDE Extension. There is no advantage to using the AWS CLI cloudformation commands 
        if you have AWS SAM CLI installed. The AWS CLI is super helpful for lots of other uses, but publishing 
        serverless stacks is easier with the AWS SAM CLI.
    </p>

    <p>The LazyStack developer tools, described in the User Guide Developer Tools section, generate serverless stack 
        code and configurations. The tools also include an AWS Settings generator that calls a published stack and 
        retrieves the information necessary to configure a client app to successfully call that stack in a secure way.
