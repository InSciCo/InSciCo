    <h3>Git Repository Integration</h3>
    <p>LazyStack implements GitHub/AWS repository integration. In general, you create one GitHub repository 
        for each Serverless Stack. Due to limitations in AWS CodeBuild, you can only configure CodeBuild 
        access to private repositories in one GitHub account from an AWS Account. It is typical to reference 
        multiple GitHub repositories in a CodeBuild project; for instance, you might reference a 
        repository containing the definition of a Serverless Stack and another repository containing 
        build utilities. Here are some allowed and disallowed use cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Typical: Single GitHub Account Serving an AWS Organization<br>
            <img src="/assets/img/GitHubSetup1.svg" width="100%"><br>
            Note that each account may have more than one serverless stack and that each serverless stack is 
            maintained in its own Git repository.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Typical: Multiple GitHub Accounts Serving Different Systems in an AWS Organization<br>
            <img src="/assets/img/GitHubSetup4.svg" width="100%">
        </li><br>
        <li>UNSUPPORTED: Multiple GitHub Accounts Serving Same System in an AWS Organization<br>
            <img src="/assets/img/GitHubSetup2.svg" width="100%">
        </li>
    </ul>
