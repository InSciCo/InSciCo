    <h3>Git Repository Integration</h3>
    <p>LazyStack implements GitHub repository integration so a GitHub account is required by LazyStack SMF. You will
        be creating one GitHub repository for each serverless stack in your AWS Organization. Due to limitations in AWS
        CodeBuild, you can only configure CodeBuild access to one GitHub account for an AWS Account; but each GitHub account 
        may reference multiple GitHub repositories. Here are some allowed and disallowed use cases:

    <ul>
        <li>Typical: Single GitHub Account Serving an AWS Organization<br>

            Note that each account may have more than one serverless stack and that each serverless stack is 
            maintained in its own Git repository.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Typical: Multiple GitHub Accounts Serving Different Systems in an AWS Organization<br>

        <li>UNSUPPORTED: Multiple GitHub Accounts Serving Same System in an AWS Organization<br>

        </li>
    </ul>
