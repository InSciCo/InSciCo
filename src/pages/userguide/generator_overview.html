    <h3>LazyStack Generate Project Tool</h3>

    <p> LazyStack ingests your application's OpenAPI specification to generate your C# projects and Serverless 
        Application Model (SAM) file(s). In addition, LazyStack reads generator "directives" from your 
        application's LazyStack.yaml file to control various generation options.
        </p>
        <p>The LazyStack Generate Project tool is available as a .NET Tool and as a Visual Studio IDE (Windows) Extension. </p>

        <p>The .NET Tools command has this syntax:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">lazystack projects [&lt;solutionfilepath>] </code></pre>
        <p>If this command is executed in the solution folder then the solutionfile path is not required as the .sln file will be used.</p>
        <p>This command is also available in the Visual Studio IDE (Windows) Tools menu.</p>
        
        <p>This command ingests your application's OpenAPI specification to generate your C# projects and Serverless 
            Application Model (SAM) file(s). In addition, LazyStack reads generator "directives" from your 
            application's LazyStack.yaml file to control various generation options. </p>
        <p>Note that your applications OpenAPI specification must have the same name as the solution file but have 
            a .yaml suffix.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>You drive what is generated by supplying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenApi Specification</strong> - your OpenApi REST specification.</li>
            <li><strong>LazyStack.yaml</strong> - LazyStack generator directives.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional AWS template</strong> - define additional AWS resources to merge into serverless.template.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>LazyStack provides many directives, these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stacks
                <p>One or more stack definitions for different purposes. These would normally include stacks for 
                    Dev, Test and Prod.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>DefaultApi
                <p>Default ApiGateway to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>ApiTagMap
                <p>Specify one or more ApiGateway configurations. AWS provides different types of ApiGateways and 
                    it is not unusual to use more than one of these in a typical stack.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>AwsResources
                <p>Create new or override existing AWS Resource specifications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>AwsTemplate
                <p>Load in an existing AWS CloudFormation template to extend your stack resources.</p>
            </li>

            <li>ProjectOptions
                <ul>
                    <li>PackageReferences</li>
