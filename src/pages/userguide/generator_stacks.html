    <h3>Stacks Directive</h3>
    <p>It is common practice to have different instances of an application stack to support Development, Test and 
        Production stacks. The configuration of each of these application stack instances vary so LazyStack 
        allows you to define stacks with unique configurations. LazyStack requires at least one Stack 
        Definition called "Dev". LazyStack following example defines additional stacks Test and Prod.
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">
Stacks:
  Dev:
    ProfileName: default
    RegionName: us-east-1 
    StackName: PetStoreDev
    Stage: Dev
    UriCodeTarget: Debug/netcoreapp3.1
  Test:
    Stage: Test
    UriCodeTarget: Debug/netcoreapp3.1
  Prod:
    Stage: Prod
    UriCodeTarget: Release/netcoreapp3.1</us-east-1></code></pre>
    <p><i>Note forward slash in UriCodeTarget property values.</i></p>

    <h4>Stacks Directive Properties</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ProfileName - (Dev stack only)</strong>
          <p> ProfileName is the AWS profile that contains your credentials for accessing an AWS account 
            with a specific role. Usually, the default profile and production profile ("minordiety" in this example) don't 
            reference the same AWS Account. We recommend that each developer to have their own separate AWS 
            development account. In most SDLC flows the developer might not have access to a production account.</p>
            <p> The ProfileName "default" is created for you when you install the AWS CLI. You may have 
            multiple profiles where each profile allows you access to different AWS accounts or different access 
            privileges in an account. We strongly recommend that you do not use your development account to host 
            production stacks. Create a separate account for production and use a production profile to access it. 
            Updating a production stack with a development stack by mistake is not a happy time.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>RegionName - (Dev stack only)</strong>
          <p> RegionName is the AWS region your stack is deployed to. RegionName is only relevant for the 
            Dev stack. The Test and Prod stack regions are determined by the LazyStack SMF.
          </p>   

        </li>
        <li><strong>StackName - (Dev stack only)</strong>
          <p>StackName is the the AWS logical stack name. The LazyStack convention used to name stacks is 
            to append the stack name to the application name. In this example the application name is "PetStore" and 
            the Stack is "Dev" so the StackName is "PetStoreDev". The StackName directive is only relevant for the 
            Dev stack. The Test and Prod stack names are determined by the LazyStack SMF.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stage</strong>
          <p>The ApiGateway stage.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>UriCodeTarget</strong>
          <p> UriCodeTarget is the build target to use. Usually one of: 
            <ul>
              <li>Debug/netcoreapp3.1</li>
              <li>Release/netcoreapp3.1</li>
            </ul>
          </p>            
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>How Stack Environments are used</h4>
    <p>When you run Generate Projects, a Stacks directory is created in your Solution Project's root directory. Then
      a sub-directory for each environment is created under that and an serverless.template file is placed into 
    that sub-directory. These serverless.template files contain the necessary information to publish an application 
    stack to AWS for that environment. For example, the Stacks Directive shown above would produce the following
     directory structure. </p>
     <pre><code class="language-powershell">
PetStore
  Stacks
    Dev 
      serverless.template 
    Test 
      serverless.template
    Prod
      serverless.template</code></pre>

<p>The Dev stack is used when you publish to your AWS Account from your Workstation. The Test and Prod stacks are used 
  by CI/CD scripts in LazyStack SMF.
</p>
<i>Note: After you publish a Dev stack you will also use LazyStack Generate Settings to generate an AwsSettings.json file 
  in the Stacks Dev folder. AwsSettings.json files contain the connection information necessary for client applications 
  to call the stack.
</i>
<p></p>
<h4>AwsSettings.json for Test and Prod Stacks</h4>
<p>Test and Prod stacks are published by the LazyStack SMF CI/CD CodeBuild processes. The CodeBuild process generates 
  an AwsSettings.json file for the published stack and places that AwsSettings.json file in the appropriate 
  stacks folder in GitHub. Do a GitHub Pull to receive the latest AwsSettings.json file for the Test or Prod stack to 
  use in your client app.
