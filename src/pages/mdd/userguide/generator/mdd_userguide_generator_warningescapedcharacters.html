    <h4>Warning - Escaped Characters</h4>
    <p>LazyStack is using yaml files to hold configuration information. You should be aware 
      of and avoid side effects of string handling differences between Yaml and the XML 
      format used in Microsoft .csproj files.
    </p>
    <p>From the yaml specification:</p>
    <em>5.7. Escaped Characters</em>
    <p>All non-printable characters must be escaped. YAML escape sequences use the “\” 
      notation common to most modern computer languages. Each escape sequence must be parsed 
      into the appropriate Unicode character. The original escape sequence is a presentation 
      detail and must not be used to convey content information.  <em>Note that escape sequences 
      are only interpreted in double-quoted scalars.</em> In all other scalar styles, the “\” 
      character has no special meaning and non-printable characters are not available.</p>
    
    <p>This is important when adding references and other strings containing backslash characters 
      to your yaml files. Consider the following ProjectReferences example:
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">  ControllerProjects:
    ProjectReferences:
    - ..\..\PetStoreRepo\PetStoreRepo.csproj</code></pre>
<p>The string is not quoted! If you did use double quotes for this 
  string, the backslash would be interpreted as an escape prefikx - not what you 
  wanted! If you have spaces in your string, you may use single quotes instead 
  of double quotes.
