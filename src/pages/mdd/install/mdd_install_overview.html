    <h3>Installation Overview</h4>
    <p>Start by configuring your workstation for access to an AWS Account and installing the AWS CLI. Next install the LazyStack .NET CLI. Optionally, install the Visual Studio IDE appropriate to your operating system. If you are using some other IDE you can usually configure it to call the .NET CLI tool to integrate LazyStack MDD into your development workflows.</p>
    <p>LazyStack MDD tools are available as a Visual Studio IDE (Windows) extension and as a .NET CLI tool. For Visual Studio IDE (MacOS), the tools are implemented as macros that make calls to the .NET CLI tool.</p>
