    <h3>Accelerate Development with LazyStack MDD</h3>
    <p>LazyStack Model Driven Development brings three great technologies together to deliver .NET apps at the lowest cost and 
        fastest time-to-market.

    <p>LazyStack is a Code Generator Tool that generates and maintains .NET code and AWS configurations based 
        on the content of a OpenAPI specification document (the model). It is open-source, free, and it enables 
        your development team to use the popular Microsoft .NET platform with AWS Cloud Services. LazyStack 
        brings three great technologies together to deliver AWS .NET Serverless applications at the lowest cost 
        and fastest time-to-market.</p>
    <p> With LazyStack, you can add all the "secret sauce" you want and scale like crazy.</p>

    <h5>Just a "little bit" Technical</h5>
     <p>The diagram below provides a high level overview of the how all these pieces fit together to stand up a AWS Serverless Stack servicing 
         a client application. Note the stars that indicate where code and configuration generated by LazyStack is used.</p>

        <p>
            The application code and template is regenerated when the specification document is updated or the code generation "pattern" is improved. 
        This increases the responsiveness of the development process to changing requirements in features or underlying technologies. 
        Model Driven Development reduces initial code development costs and ongoing code maintenance costs.</p>
