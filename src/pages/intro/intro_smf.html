    <h3>Software Management Framework (SMF)</h3>
    <p>Managing software development, testing, deployment and maintenance is critical to your business success. LazyStack 
        provides a complete end-to-end software development management tool-chain tailored to and integrated seamlessly 
        with AWS and GitHub. GitHub is a very popular software version control repository service. 
    </p>
    <p>The LazyStack SMF helps ensure your team is collaborating effectively on delivering new features and code fixes to your 
        customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. The LazyStack SMF provides the tools, templates, scripts,
         practices, and examples necessary to implement the tool-chain quickly and with confidence that it complies 
         with industry best-practices.</p>

    <p>Implementing LazyStack SMF:
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a secure AWS Organization following all AWS best practices</li>
            <li>Provides integration with GitHub for secure software version management</li>
            <li>Provides a solid foundation for coordinating development teams</li>
            <li>Provides for managing multiple "Systems", each with multiple "Stacks"</li>
            <li>Painlessly publishes Testing and Production stack updates</li>
            <li>Provides developers with a rapid prototyping and development sandbox in their own AWS Account</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>A very high level overview of a simple AWS Organization with one developer, and one system containing a single 
        serverless stack looks like this:</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSMF3.svg" width="100%">       
    <p></p>
    <p>Note: Your real organization would replace "Org" and "Sys" with names appropriate to your needs.</p>
    <p>The organization described above complies with AWS best-practice for security and cost management. Organizational 
        Units are used to group Accounts to enable simple resource policy management. Stacks are published in separate 
        Accounts to better manage and isolate the resources they use and who has access to them. Software development 
        collaboration is accomplished using the popular GitHub service.</p>

    <p>And of course we may need to manage multiple application stacks. Below we show two stacks. One serving
        a consumer app and a second one serving a back office app. Notice that we have separate GitHub 
        repositories for each app's source code in this example.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSMF5.svg" width="100%">      
    <p>* Not showing development and testing app connections to reduce clutter. We are showing icons for the primary AWS 
        services used to manage the organization, accounts and integration with GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a very high level overview of an organization with multiple developers and two systems: Sys and Sys2. 
        Systems are often used to isolate and separately manage different lines of business or customers.

    <h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>Use AWS Organizations to manage one or more systems containing one or more serverless stacks. Use GitHub to 
        manage collaboration among multiple developers and AWS services to test and deploy test and production stacks.
