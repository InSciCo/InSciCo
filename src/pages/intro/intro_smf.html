    <h3>Software Management Framework (SMF)</h3>
    <p>Managing software development, testing, deployment and maintenance is critical to your business success. LazyStack 
        provides a complete end-to-end software development management tool-chain tailored to and integrated seamlessly 
        with AWS and GitHub. GitHub is a very popular software version control repository service. 
    </p>
    <p>The LazyStack SMF helps ensure your team is collaborating effectively on delivering new features and code fixes to your 
        customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. The LazyStack SMF provides the tools, templates, scripts,
         practices, and examples necessary to implement the tool-chain quickly and with confidence that it complies 
         with industry best-practices.</p>

    <p>Implementing LazyStack SMF:
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a secure AWS Organization following all AWS best practices</li>
            <li>Provides integration with GitHub for secure software version management</li>
            <li>Provides a solid foundation for coordinating development teams</li>
            <li>Painlessly publishes Testing and Production stack updates</li>
            <li>Provides developers with a rapid prototyping and development sandbox in their own AWS Account</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>A very high level overview of the AWS Organization created looks something like this:</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSMF2.svg" width="100%">       
    <p></p>
    <p>The organization described above complies with AWS best-practice for security and cost management. LazyStack SMF can be used with 
        or without the LazyStack Development tools.</p>

    <p>And of course we need to manage multiple application stacks. Below we show two stacks. One serving
        a consumer app and a second one serving a backoffice app.

    <p>* Not showing development and testing app connections to reduce clutter.</p>
    <p>You may have as many serverless stacks as you need and they can serve entirely different applications.
