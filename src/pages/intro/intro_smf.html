        <ul>
            <li>One or more Developers in Organization</li>
            <li>One or more Systems in an Organization<br>
                Systems are used to isolate resources like databases by line-of-business, product, or customer.
                <ul>
                    <li>One or more Serverless Stacks in a System<br>Multiple serverless stacks separate sub-systems. For instance you 
                    might have a Consumer stack that services a consumer mobile app and a Backoffice stack that services 
                    a desktop application that employees use.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
