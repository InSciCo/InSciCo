    <h3>It all starts with your REST API Specification</h3>
    <p>In a typical LazyStack application you start by writing an <strong>OpenAPI Specification</strong>, and then
        running LazyStack to generate C# projects in your Microsoft Solution. Then you extend the Application Services
        Code generated by LazyStack with your application specific logic. LazyStack also generates am application
        ClientSDK you use to effect calls to the Serverless Application stack from your client.</p>
    
        <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSimpleFlow.svg"/>
        <p></p>
    <p>LazyStack uses the OpenAPI (swagger) definition, along with an optional LazyStack.yaml configuration file, to
        generate all the necessary configuration and lambda functions to stand up a .NET Core Serverless Application
        Model (SAM) Stack on AWS. </p>
    <h3>OpenApi Tags Create Lambdas</h3>
    <p>The OpenApi specification allows the definition of &ldquo;tags&rdquo; and then allows each route (path +
        HttpOperation) to be associated with zero or more tags. LazyStack creates a Lambda for each tag and creates
        Lambda events (methods that handle a call to a route) for each route associated with that tag. This makes it 
        really simple to map your API calls to specific lambda implementation.</p>
    <h4>Lambdas use AspNetCore.ControllerBase</h4>
    <p>Each function lambda&rsquo;s events are handled by methods in a class derived from AspNetCore.ControllerBase.
        This is the class in which you implement the application logic for each route served by the function lambda.
    </p>
    <p>The ControllerBase class handles all the busywork required to resolve routes (path + HttpOperation) to
        methods defined in classes that inherit from ControllerBase. The Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer class allows 
        classes derived from ControllerBase to be easily used in a lambda and the lambda may use all the normal 
        configuration and dependency injection goodness provided by .NET.</p>
    <p>A lambda uses a single controller class so it is very simple to follow the code generation path from the
        OpenApi tag specification to the class that handles routes associated with that tag:</p>
