        <p></p>
        <p> We provide clear documentation for setting up the SMF and automate much of that process 
            with PowerShell scripts. The diagram below outlines the SMF Setup.

        <p>Once your SMF is setup, your team follows a simple feature development workflow using 
             GitHub Pull Requests augmented with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment 
             in the System Test Account and Continuous Deployment in the System Production Account.</p>
