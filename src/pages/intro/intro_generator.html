    <h3>LazyStack Stack Generator</h3>
    <p>You write the REST OpenAPI specification (formerly Swagger). This defines your client facing API including
        the operations and data schema your client may use on the API. This is where you spend most of your time using
        LazyStack because the OpenAPI specification is used to guide the generation and update of the code projects
        that make up your stack and update the SAM template file so that stack can be deployed to AWS. </p>
    <p>Each time you finalize edits to your API specification or the optional SAM template, you run the LazyStack
        generator and the following LazyStack Generation Steps are performed: </p>

    <h4>Now It's Your Turn to Write Some Code </h4>
    <p>We provide a Getting Started Tutorial based on a version of the ubiquitous PetStore API. This tutorial takes
        you
        through installing LazyStack and building your first stack. </p>
    <p>LazyStack doesn&rsquo;t require you to adopt any particular Source Control, Continuous Integration or
        Continuous
        Deployment service. You can run through our tutorial without using anything but your AWS account, AWS CLI (or
        Visual Studio integration) and LazyStack itself. </p>
    <h3>On the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h3>
    <p>As you start to move toward fielding a production stack you inevitably start to manage different versions of
        your
        stack; at a minimum this might include separate stacks for Development, Test and Production. To manage
        separate
        stacks and the promotion of changes among them, without going crazy, you need a process and a set of tools to
        implement that process.</p>
    <p>In our experience, the requirements on the SDLC process used by a startup and that used by an enterprise are
        wildly different. We strive to make LazyStack easy to integrate into any of those processes. </p>
    <p>Since startups may not require or afford the overhead of sophisticated SDLC tooling, we provide a LazyStack
        SDLC
        tutorial supporting a minimal process with common tools like Visual Studio, AWS Visual Studio Toolkit, AWS SAM
        CLI
        and GitHub.</p>
    <p>Multiple contributors can work on LazyStack generated application stacks at the same time. The LazyStack SDLC
        tutorial demonstrates coordination among multiple contributors to your application stack project.</p>
