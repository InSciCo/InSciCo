    <h3>Why AWS?</h3>
    <p>If you are wondering why we didn&rsquo;t build LazyStack on Azure, the reason is quite simple. Azure does not
        currently offer all the services required for a secure scalable serverless commercial-grade stack in their
        <strong>free-tier</strong>. While Azure, Google and AWS offer a lot of similar services, AWS offers the
        following
        unique free-tier features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Ability to signup/manage large numbers of users for free. Cognito allows 50,000 Monthly Active Users
                (&ldquo;MAU&rdquo;) before you start paying for user management activities like Sign-up, Sign-in,
                Reset-Password, Update Email and more. This allows mobile apps to be widely used before costs start to
                accrue.
                Our assumption, here at LazyStack, is that you should have a pretty good idea of how successful your
                mobile
                app will be before you hit 50,000 MAU and may even have some monetization from your app to offset cloud
                hosting costs by that time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Encryption-at-rest is free in the DynamoDB. Encryption-at-rest is absolutely necessary for any
                application
                that wants to comply with existing and emerging data privacy regulations. Even on AWS RDS, encryption at
                rest
                is not available in the free-tier services.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note, that in our opinion, both Google and Azure are also great PaaS providers and we may implement
        LazyStack support for those providers in the future. However, our mission is to allow developers to quickly
        field
        mobile applications using scalable cloud based resources at the lowest initial cost, without sacrificing
        security,
        scalability or features; we could do this only on AWS when we started this project.</p>
    <p>Our focused passion is automating stacks based on the .NET/AWS marriage; hopefully we can help those of you
        who
        need or want to use that powerful combination as well. We are aware that PaaS pricing and features change all
        the
        time in the &ldquo;cloud wars&rdquo; so be sure to check on current pricing and features before picking the
        best
        cloud provider for your application stack and be sure to let us know what you find if any
        &ldquo;game-changers&rdquo; emerge. </p>
