    <h3>Model Driven Development (MDD) Tools</h3>
    <p>LazyStack accelerates software development using Model Driven Development. LazyStack brings three great technologies together to 
        deliver apps at the lowest cost and fastest time-to-market.</p>

    <p>LazyStack Model Driven Development generates code and resource configurations from an OpenAPI "specification" document. This 
        document contains a list of all the operations a client can call on the application service along with exactly what data 
        may be transmitted with or received from those calls. From the client application's perspective, the OpenAPI specification 
        fully defines what the application service can do for it.
    </p>   
     <p>LazyStack reads the OpenAPI specification and generates much of the application code and Serverless Application Model (SAM) template content 
        necessary to stand up your serverless stack so your development team focus on your 
        application specific logic.</p>

        The application code and template is regenerated when the specification document is updated or the code generation "pattern" is improved. 
        This increases the responsiveness of the development process to changing requirements in features or underlying technologies. 
        Model Driven Development reduces initial code development costs and ongoing code maintenance costs.</p>
    
    <h5>An OpenAPI Specification is a Great Collaboration Tool for Stakeholders and Developers</h5>
    <p>An OpenAPI specification is not a difficult document to read and this makes it a collaboration tool that both business stakeholders 
        and developers can "huddle" around when discussing new features or feature enhancement. It allows stakeholders to become 
        intimately familiar with what's going on when the app client calls the application service, without having to read or understand 
        the code behind that call. It allows developers to more accurately estimate the development effort required to implement or enhance 
        features.
