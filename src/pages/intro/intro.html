    <h3>LazyStack Executive Overview</h3>
<p> LazyStack's mission is to enable technical entrepreneurs to quickly field
    mobile and web applications leveraging scalable cloud-based resources at the lowest initial cost, without sacrificing
    security, scalability or features. LazyStack leverages the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to enable you to 
    build and deploy "application stacks" in the AWS cloud.</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/ThreeGreatTechnologies.svg" width="100%">
    <p></p>
    <p>It is best practice to create an API specification that defines all the service features available on your AWS Stack. Your 
        client application uses this specification to implement calls to the AWS Stack. The amount of 
        "plumbing" code and AWS stack configuration necessary to implement a feature rich API specification is often quite large. 
        Plumbing code connects the client app and AWS Lambda function implementing a stack feature. 
        Plumbing code is "repetitive", making it an excellent candidate for code generation. 
        In addition, writing complete and correct "SAM" templates used to deploy a stack on AWS is tedious and 
        requires an intimate knowledge of AWS resources. </p>
   
    </p>LazyStack eliminates labor intensive and error prone coding and template development so your team sees real business 
     benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear Requirements
        <ul>
            <li>An API specification reduces misunderstandings and wasted implementation cycles.</li>
            <li>API specifications can be versioned, making it simple to manage incremental improvement in a product.</li>
            <li>API specifications make it easy to partner with other parties.</li>
            <li>API specifications make it easier to explain technical concepts to business stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Tools exist to help author effective API specifications.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lower Cost Development
        <ul>
            <li>Expensive hand-coding of "repetitive" plumbing code is eliminated.</li>
            <li>Innovation is easier because new plumbing code and templates are automatically generated when the API specification changes.</li>
            <li>Generated code is consistent, bug-free and reliably compliant with best-practices.</li>
            <li>Developers are freed up to work on features that can't be generated.</li>
            <li>Generated code is far less expensive to test and verify.</li>
            <li>LazyStack publishes a number of open-source MIT licensed libraries to kick-start your app development.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lower Cost DevOps 
        <ul>
            <li>Leverages AWS Serverless Application Model - generates AWS SAM templates from API Specification.</li>
            <li>Generated templates demonstrate correct configuration of AWS resources.</li>
            <li>Generated templates are consistent, bug-free and reliably compliant to best-practices.</li>
            <li>Generated templates can be easily extended with hand-coded resource specifications.</li>
            <li>Manage Dev, Test and Prod stacks with simple Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</li>
            <li>LazyStack easily integrates with advanced SDLC like CI services as business grows.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>LazyStack makes innovation faster and less expensive by reducing the costs associated with code and 
        stack configuration changes. LazyStack accelerates your time-to-market so you start monetizing your 
        app earlier. Leveraging the AWS Serverless Application Model ensures your app has the potential to 
        scale reliably and quickly and launch at low cost using AWS free-tier services.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Why did we build LazyStack?</h3>
<p>Technical Entrepreneurs generally have more ideas than capital. LazyStack makes it easier to bring a fully
    functional application stack to market at a very low development and operational cost so more of these ideas
    can be market tested until viable monetization is demonstrable. The recent &ldquo;Fail Fast&rdquo; mantra 
    does have some merit, but only if your application attempt doesn&rsquo;t fail in the technical sense. 
    LazyStack generates commercial grade production stacks that can be used in support of prototype apps but 
    also for production apps.</p>
<p>A Technical Entrepreneur may be a single person or a team where the aggregate skill-sets include product
    definition, product development, product testing, product marketing/sales and product support. We leave
    general
    business management and capital raise out of this definition because it is often necessary to demonstrate an
    app
    with modest market acceptance before you can raise capital to scale up. </p>
<p>We would also observe that even in larger organizations it is sometimes a &ldquo;skunk works&rdquo; team that
    fits our definition of Technical Entrepreneur. </p>
<p>So, why did we usurp the term LazyStack? There&rsquo;s an old adage, &ldquo;Only lazy programmers write code
    generators and only code generators can produce bug-free code; thus only lazy programmers write bug-free
    code&rdquo;. Tongue firmly in cheek here! Well, OK then, why not whole stacks?</p>
