    <h3>LazyStack Executive Overview</h3>
<p> LazyStack's mission is to enable technical entrepreneurs to quickly field
    mobile and web applications leveraging scalable cloud-based resources at the lowest initial cost, without sacrificing
    security, scalability or features. LazyStack leverages the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to enable you to 
    build and deploy "application stacks" in the AWS cloud.</p>
    <p>It is best practice to create an API specification that defines all the service features available on your AWS Stack. Your 
        client application uses this specification to implement calls to the AWS Stack. The amount of 
        "plumbing" code and AWS stack configuration necessary to implement a feature rich API specification is often quite large. 
        Plumbing code connects the client app and AWS Lambda function implementing a stack feature. 
        Plumbing code is repetitive and "boring" to write, making it an excellent candidate for code generation. 
        In addition, writing complete and correct "SAM" templates used to deploy a stack on AWS is tedious and 
        requires an intimate knowledge of AWS resources. </p>
   
    </p>LazyStack eliminates labor intensive and error prone coding and template development so see real business 
     benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear Requirements
        <ul>
            <li>An API specification reduces misunderstandings and wasted implementation cycles.</li>
            <li>API specifications can be versioned, making it simple to manage incremental improvement in a product.</li>
            <li>API specifications make it easy to partner with other parties.</li>
            <li>API specifications make it easier to explain technical concepts to business stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Tools exist to help author effective API specifications.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lower Cost Development
        <ul>
            <li>Expensive hand-coding of "boring" plumbing code is eliminated.</li>
            <li>Innovation is easier because new plumbing code and templates are automatically generated when the API specification changes.</li>
            <li>Generated code is consistent, bug-free and reliably compliant with best-practices.</li>
            <li>Developers are freed up to work on features that can't be generated.</li>
            <li>Generated code is far less expensive to test and verify.</li>
            <li>LazyStack publishes a number of open-source MIT licensed libraries to kick-start your app development.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lower Cost DevOps 
        <ul>
            <li>Leverages AWS Serverless Application Model - generates AWS SAM templates from API Specification.</li>
            <li>Generated templates demonstrate correct configuration of AWS resources.</li>
            <li>Generated templates are consistent, bug-free and reliably compliant to best-practices.</li>
            <li>Generated templates can be easily extended with hand-coded resource specifications.</li>
            <li>Manage Dev, Test and Prod stacks with simple Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</li>
            <li>LazyStack easily integrates with advanced SDLC like CI services as business grows.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>LazyStack makes innovation faster and less expensive by reducing the costs associated with code and 
        stack configuration changes. LazyStack accelerates your time-to-market so you start monetizing your 
        app earlier. Leveraging the AWS Serverless Application Model ensures your app has the potential to 
        scale reliably and quickly and launch at low cost using AWS free-tier services.</p>
</ul>
<h4>What is LazyStack?</h4>
<p>LazyStack ingests an OpenApi (swagger) REST API specification and generates the AWS Server Application Model
    (SAM) configuration and C# projects necessary to stand up a fully featured commercial-grade application stack
    in AWS. It also generates a client application SDK making it simple to call that stack from C# applications.</p>
<p>LazyStack is comprised of a free stack generator tool and some MIT licensed open-source support libraries.</p>
<ul>
    <li>LazyStack Generator - Free Visual Studio IDE Extension, and Free DOTNET CLI Tool </li>
    <li>LazyStackAuth - MIT Licensed authentication library</li>
    <li>LazyStackDynamoDBRepo - MIT Licensed CRUDL library for DynamoDB</li>
</ul>
