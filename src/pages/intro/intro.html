    <h3>LazyStack Executive Overview</h3>
<p> LazyStack's mission is to enable technical entrepreneurs to quickly field mobile and web applications leveraging 
    scalable cloud-based resources at the lowest initial cost, without sacrificing security, scalability or features. 
    LazyStack provides all the necessary setup instruction and tools necessary develop, test, maintain and deploy AWS 
    Serverless Application Model (SAM) "application stacks".</p>

    <h4>LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF)</h4>
    <p>Managing software development can be hard. Developing the tools, practices and documentation necessary to effectively 
        manage software development can be even harder. The LazyStack SMF includes the tools, templates, scripts, practices,
        and examples to set up an effective Software Management Framework with AWS Serverless Stacks in mind. Use our "suggested" SMF to get 
        started quickly with effective best-practices or just review our SMF for hints on how to integrate the 
        LazyStack development tools into your existing Software Management Practices. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p> LazyStack SMF includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure AWS Organization and Accounts following all AWS best practices</li>
        <li>Integrated Software Source Management using GitHub, integrated with AWS and development tools</li>
        <li>Team coordination using the popular Feature Branch Workflow with GitHub Pull Requests (Pull Requests are requests by 
            developers for approval of new features)
        </li>
        <li>Application quality assurance with Continuous Integration (CI)</li>
        <li>Timely production updates with Continuous Deployment (CD)</li>
        <li>Rapid development/prototyping leveraging individual AWS Developer accounts/sandboxes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>LazyStack Model Driven Development (MDD) Tools</h4>
    <p>LazyStack MDD brings three great technologies together to delivery apps at the lowest cost and fastest time-to-market.</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/ThreeGreatTechnologies.svg" width="100%">
    <p></p>
    <p>Model Driven Development generates code and resource configurations from a "specification" document. The code can be 
        regenerated when the specification document is updated or the code generation "pattern" is improved. This increases the 
        responsiveness of the development process to changing requirements in features or underlying technologies.
    </p>
    <p>Model Driven Development reduces costs for initial code development and ongoing code maintenance. Web and mobile clients 
        communicate with Internet services that publish a Application Program Interface (API). These APIs define each 
        available operation and the types of data that may be exchanged. A common "language" for defining an 
        service API is the OpenAPI specification. </p>

        <p>Reading an OpenAPI specification is not difficult so they are an ideal tool for business stakeholders 
            and the development team to collaborate on application features dependant on the client calling the service. It is 
        often useful to enumerate the API operations an application feature will use. This improves the stakeholders understanding 
        of how the application works and allows developers to better estimate and execute feature implementation.</p>

        <p>LazyStack MDD tools ingest an OpenAPI specification and then generates all the plumbing code and AWS Resource specifications necessary 
        to deploy and use AWS Serverless application stacks. This Model Driven Development (MDD) approach improves the management of your application 
        requirements, and lowers development and DevOps costs. LazyStack reduces hand coding and manual AWS resource configuration so you see 
        real business benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear Requirements
        <ul>
            <li>An API specification reduces misunderstandings and wasted implementation cycles.</li>
            <li>API specifications can be versioned, making it simple to manage incremental improvement in a product.</li>
            <li>API specifications make it easy to partner with other parties.</li>
            <li>API specifications make it easier to discuss application features with business stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Tools exist to help author effective API specifications.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lower Cost Development
        <ul>
            <li>Expensive hand-coding of "repetitive" plumbing code is eliminated.</li>
            <li>Innovation is easier because new plumbing code and templates are automatically generated when the API specification changes.</li>
            <li>Generated code is consistent, bug-free and reliably compliant with best-practices.</li>
            <li>Developers are freed up to work on features that can't be generated.</li>
            <li>Generated code is far less expensive to test and verify.</li>
            <li>LazyStack publishes a number of open-source MIT licensed libraries to kick-start your app development.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lower Cost DevOps 
        <ul>
            <li>Leverages AWS Serverless Application Model - generates AWS SAM templates from API Specification.</li>
            <li>Generated templates demonstrate correct configuration of AWS resources.</li>
            <li>Generated templates are consistent, bug-free and reliably compliant to best-practices.</li>
            <li>Generated templates can be easily extended with hand-coded resource specifications.</li>
            <li>Manage Dev, Test and Prod stacks with AWS CodeBuild Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>LazyStack makes innovation faster and less expensive by reducing the costs associated with code and 
        stack configuration changes. LazyStack accelerates your time-to-market so you start monetizing your 
        app earlier. Leveraging the AWS Serverless Application Model ensures your app has the potential to 
        scale reliably and quickly and launch at low cost using AWS free-tier services.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Why did we build LazyStack?</h3>
<p>Technical Entrepreneurs generally have more ideas than capital. LazyStack makes it easier to bring a fully
    functional application stack to market at a very low development and operational cost so more of these ideas
    can be market tested until viable monetization is demonstrable. The recent &ldquo;Fail Fast&rdquo; mantra 
    does have some merit, but only if your application attempt doesn&rsquo;t fail in the technical sense. 
    LazyStack generates commercial grade production stacks that can be used in support of prototype apps but 
    also for production apps.</p>
<p>A Technical Entrepreneur may be a single person or a team where the aggregate skill-sets include product
    definition, product development, product testing, product marketing/sales and product support. We leave
    general
    business management and capital raise out of this definition because it is often necessary to demonstrate an
    app
    with modest market acceptance before you can raise capital to scale up. </p>
<p>We would also observe that even in larger organizations it is sometimes a &ldquo;skunk works&rdquo; team that
    fits our definition of Technical Entrepreneur. </p>
<p>So, why did we usurp the term LazyStack? There&rsquo;s an old adage, &ldquo;Only lazy programmers write code
    generators and only code generators can produce bug-free code; thus only lazy programmers write bug-free
    code&rdquo;. Tongue firmly in cheek here! Well, OK then, why not whole stacks?</p>
