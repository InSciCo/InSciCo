    <h3>LazyStack Business Stakeholder Overview</h3>
    <p>The AWS Services Infrastructure is vast and can be intimidating and costly to get started with. The objective of LazyStack SMF is to demystify the complexities of AWS services and security infrastructure by providing concrete implementations of these services and a prescriptive approach to using them to build AWS Serverless Applications. This reduces the technical risks and costs associated with adopting AWS as your Serverless Application cloud platform.
    </p>
    <p>LazyStack SMF has extensive documentation that serves as a “blueprint” for a development shop wanting to get started with AWS/.NET serverless application development. The LazyStack SMF is comprised of PowerShell management scripts and CloudFormation templates that automate everything that can be automated in setting up and managing a comprehensive serverless stack development pipeline using AWS Services. LazyStack SMF also works seamlessly with our LazyStack Model Driven Development (MDD) tool.

<p>Our mission is to be a "startup in a box".</p>
<p>The LazyStack Software Management Framework (SMF) ensures your collaborative development process, test process, and production 
    deployments are managed efficiently and securely. The LazyStack Model Driven Development (MDD) development tools 
    reduce development costs, improve development agility, and decrease time to market for your products.

<h3>Why did we build LazyStack?</h3>
<p>Technical Entrepreneurs generally have more ideas than capital. LazyStack makes it easier to bring a fully
    functional application stack to market at a very low development and operational cost so more of these ideas
    can be market tested until viable monetization is demonstrable. The recent &ldquo;Fail Fast&rdquo; mantra 
    does have some merit, but only if your application attempt doesn&rsquo;t fail in the technical sense. 
    LazyStack generates commercial grade production stacks that both support rapid prototype development and are 
    robust enough for production apps. Generated code truly lets us have our cake and eat it too. </p>

<p>A Technical Entrepreneur may be a single person or a team where the aggregate skill-sets include product
    definition, product development, product testing, product marketing/sales and product support. We leave
    general
    business management and capital raise out of this definition because it is often necessary to demonstrate an
    app
    with modest market acceptance before you can raise capital to scale up. </p>
<p>We would also observe that even in larger organizations it is sometimes a &ldquo;skunk works&rdquo; team that
    fits our definition of Technical Entrepreneur. </p>

<p> So, why the name: LazyStack? Hlade's Law states: "If you have a difficult task, give it to a lazy person; they will find an 
    easier way to do it". Code generation is the easy way to accomplish robust stack deployment. 
    Frankly, we wouldn't want to handwrite any of this code ever again and we can't imagine you'd want to either.</p>
