    <h3>LazyStackSaaS</h3>
    <h5>Note - LazyStackSaaS is currently in Alpha with select partners. Beta release is expected in late June or early July. If you would like to try out LazyStackSaaS in the Beta program and receive direct support, please contact us. Support for beta users that agree to be reference accounts is free.</h5>

    <p>LazyStack manages the configuration and deployment of multi-tenant SaaS applications that follow the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). When deploying a SAM application we configure services instead of dedicated servers.</p>
    <p>Multi-tenant SaaS application core features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tenant on-boarding, branding and content management is simple and performant</li>
        <li>Tenants may self-onboard</li>
        <li>Tenant data is isolated and secure</li>
        <li>Client apps and Services are fully secure and follow all best practices</li>
        <li>Configuration or code change automatically rebuilds and deploys:
            <ul>
                <li>Client apps</li>
                <li>Services</li>
                <li>Tenant specific resources</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Configure client apps, assets and services based on tenant needs: 
            <ul>
                <li>Client App Branding and Configuration</li>
                <li>Client App Assets (Content Management System)</li>
                <li>Bespoke Client Apps</li>
                <li>Bespoke Services</li>
                <li>Bespoke Integrations</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Application scales up and down easily and can be constrained by budgets</li>
        <li>Application is architected to support certification in regulated industries</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Building a multi-tenant SaaS application from scratch is challenging and time-consuming. Use LazyStack SaaS and AWS services to cut months off of your development schedule, start with a basket of robust core features, reduce costs and reduce project risk.</p>

    <P>LazyStack SaaS follows all AWS best practices to ensure your platform is secure and can be more easily certified when subject to regulatory compliance.</P>
    <p>The platform uses the AWS Serverless Applications Model. This means that only AWS managed services are used in the platform. AWS managed services require very little DevOps effort from your team - instead, AWS handles all the day-to-day maintenance and upkeep of these services. This includes scaling those services as your application takes off.</p>
    <h3>Robust Enterprise Multi-Tenant Features</h3>

    <p></p>
    <p>LazyStack SaaS platform features add immediate value and opportunity to your application. The features we have included in the base platform are based on common requirements we have addressed for bespoke and commercial applications.</p>
    <h3>Focus on Your Special Sauce</h3>
    <img src="/assets/img/LazyStackSaaSBoxes2.drawio.svg" width="100%">
    <p></p>
    <p>LazyStack SaaS integrates the LazyStack Model Driven Development toolchain to accelerate and coordinate development efforts. </p>
    <h5>Use your language of choice to build your Client App and Service Lambdas</h5>
    <p>LazyStack SaaS is written in .NET but your Client App and Service Lambdas can be written in your language of choice. We recommend using .NET for your service lambdas but you can, for instance, use Node.js, Go, or Java. Since LazyStack SaaS stands up CloudFront Distributions with ApiGateway REST endpoints, you can use any Client App language.</p>

    <h5>LazyStack Model Driven Development tool is optional</h5>
    <p>We eat our own dog food here at ISC and use the LazyStack MDD tool to build and maintain LazyStack SaaS. However, if you want to make extensions or enhancement to LazyStack SaaS in-house, using LazyStack MDD is recommended but not required. Additionally, LazyStack MDD is not required to develop or maintain applications deployed with LazyStack SaaS.</p>

    <h4>Protect Your Intellectual Property</h4>
    <p>Software licensing can get complicated! So LazyStack SaaS is dual-licensed. The LazyStack SaaS Community Edition (LazyStack SaaS CE) is licensed under the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) and the LazyStack SaaS Enterprise Edition (LazyStack SaaS EE) is subject to the LazyStack SaaS End User Agreement and is made available to LazyStack Enterprise Subscription customers at no extra charge.</p>

    <p>LazyStack SaaS Community Edition (LazyStack SaaS CE) is most suitable for use by customers that can provide internal support and where open source license compliance and management are not a concern. For user's that need to extend the platform, there are the usual concerns related to the "viral effects" of certain "copyleft" open source license schemes. In response to these concerns, ISC provides LazyStack SaaS EE under the dual licensing model described below.</p>

    <p>LazyStack SaaS Enterprise Edition (LazyStack SaaS EE) is most suitable for use by enterprise-class customers and in mission-critical deployments and where open source license compliance and management are major concerns.  This approach significantly mitigates, for our enterprise customers, the costly and complicated burden of open source license compliance and management. With ISC's LazyStack SaaS EE you have the freedom to customize your own solution and control your intellectual property.</p>

    <p>This "dual licensing" model is made possible by the manner in which LazyStack manages the LazyStack SaaS open source project. Both LazyStack SaaS CE and LazyStack SaaS EE are based on the same open source and community developed software project. The source code added to the core repository of LazyStack SaaS is provided both by Insight Sciences Corporation (ISC) software developers as well as community contributors. LazyStack accepts code contributions for the platform from community developers only if the code passes ISC's strict quality standards. Code contributors either license their contribution to ISC or assign the contribution to ISC. The result is a diligently managed code base and the freedom for ISC to package and license LazyStack SaaS in ways that best benefit both community users and our enterprise-class customers.</p>

    <p>Developing and maintaining sophisticated platforms like LazyStack SaaS is expensive. We offer the dual licensing so we can generate revenue with the LazyStack SaaS Enterprise Edition to continue funding development of the platform.</p>

    <h4>LazyStack Support Libraries use Permissive MIT License</h4>
    <p>LazyStack support libraries, build scripts, app templates, stack templates and associated policies, contain code more likely to be embedded in your proprietary client app, services code or build processes. These codes are normally tailored by your team as part of setting up your applications configuration and deployment. We provide templates and examples of these codes. These templates and examples use the highly permissive MIT license to eliminate open source license compliance and management concerns for applications deployed and managed by LazyStack SaaS.</p>
