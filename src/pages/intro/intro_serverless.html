    <h3>Serverless Applications</h3>
    <p>AWS provides the Serverless Application Model (SAM) that provides business stakeholders and 
        the technical team with a valuable "center of mass" for application development, 
        deployment and maintenance.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>A serverless stack looks deceptively simple and this is why it is so useful. AWS is doing 
        all the complicated management required behind the scene to keep things simple without 
        giving up any functionality. Each serverless stack is defined by a "SAM Template" and 
        your application code. The SAM Template defines all the resources and their configurations 
        necessary to stand up your stack. The SAM template and application code are sent to a service 
        called AWS Cloud Formation which creates/updates all the resources for your application stack.
    </p>

    <p>Without much technical detail, this is what each of these resources in this stack do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AWS Cognito<br>User Sign Up, Sign In, Reset Password, etc.</li>
        <li>API Gateway<br>This service is a "traffic cop", taking calls from client applications,
            ensuring those calls are properly secured, are within traffic limits, and then
            sending those calls on to other services.
        </li>
        <li>AWS Lambda Function(s)<br>These are programs that implement your business logic. These 
            programs are numerous and intentionally small.  
            AWS automatically scales these functions to accommodate application traffic.</li>
        <li>AWS S3 - file storage<br>This is storage for files like images and documents.</li>
        <li>AWS DynamoDB<br>A highly scalable database. Other databases may also be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What is the Serverless Application Model (SAM)?</h4>
    <p>AWS SAM is an open-source framework for building applications using serverless architecture. 
        AWS defines serverless architecture as a way to build and run applications and services without 
        having to manage infrastructure. These applications still run on servers, but all the 
        server management is done by AWS. You no longer have to provision, scale, and 
        maintain servers to run your applications, databases, and storage systems.
    </p>

    <p>Another important advantage of serverless architecture is the "on-demand" nature of 
        many of the services available for use in the serverless architecture. An on-demand 
        service only runs when demand exists and has little or no cost when unused. AWS offers a comprehensive 
        suite of on-demand services you can configure for use in a serverless architecture.
    </p>

    <p>It's hard to understate how important the AWS SAM is to small teams developing, testing,
        deploying, and managing cloud based applications. In contrast, traditional cloud-based applications 
        required your team to create and manage "servers" and network infrastructure that incurred
        very expensive "DevOps" management and sometimes fundamental re-design of the application as they 
        moved to production. While there are applications that still benefit from a traditional architecture,
        many applications can be implemented  using the AWS SAM.
    </p>

    <p>To sum it up; using AWS SAM will help you develop, test, deploy, and maintain your cloud-based 
        application with a smaller team, at a lower cost, without sacrificing features, security or scalability.</p>
    
    <h4>Reducing Business Stakeholder and Technical Team Lead Tension</h4>
    <p>There is always a healthy tension among business stakeholders and technical leads. Business stakeholders top 
        application priorities often include costs, time-to-market, quality, and features. Technical leads top priorities 
        often include development cadence, technology selection, following best practices, avoiding technical obsolescence, 
        talent acquisition, and development agility. The apparent conflict in priorities are an illusion as both 
        parties are really working toward the same goal of delivering a successful application to users - this success is 
        measured as the aggregate success of all the priorities mentioned. The tension stems from a lack of effective 
        communication and understanding of the relative importance and trade-offs among these priorities.
       </p>

    <p>Using the AWS SAM can help dramatically reduce this tension by giving the business stakeholder and technical lead a common 
        "play book" that both can understand and agree to follow.
