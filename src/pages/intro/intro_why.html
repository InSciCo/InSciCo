    <h3>Why did we build LazyStack?</h3>
<p>Technical Entrepreneurs generally have more ideas than capital. LazyStack makes it easier to bring a fully
    functional application stack to market at a very low development and operational cost so more of these ideas
    can be market tested until viable monetization is demonstrable. The recent &ldquo;Fail Fast&rdquo; mantra 
    does have some merit, but only if your application attempt doesn&rsquo;t fail in the technical sense. 
    LazyStack generates commercial grade production stacks that can be used in support of prototype apps but 
    also for production apps.</p>
<p>A Technical Entrepreneur may be a single person or a team where the aggregate skill-sets include product
    definition, product development, product testing, product marketing/sales and product support. We leave
    general
    business management and capital raise out of this definition because it is often necessary to demonstrate an
    app
    with modest market acceptance before you can raise capital to scale up. </p>
<p>We would also observe that even in larger organizations it is sometimes a &ldquo;skunk works&rdquo; team that
    fits our definition of Technical Entrepreneur. </p>
<p>So, why did we usurp the term LazyStack? There&rsquo;s an old adage, &ldquo;Only lazy programmers write code
    generators and only code generators can produce bug-free code; thus only lazy programmers write bug-free
    code&rdquo;. Tongue firmly in cheek here! Well, OK then, why not whole stacks?</p>
