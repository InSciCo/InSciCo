    <h3>PetStoreTests Project</h3>
    <p>In this step we will create a PetStoreTest project to perform an integration test against the 
        PetStoreDev stack. We will test:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application SignUp - using the LazyStackAuth library. </li>
        <li>Application SignIn - using the LazyStackAuth library. </li>
        <li>Calling the stack using the PetStore - defined in the PetStoreClientSDK library.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8.1 Configure a Gmail Account</h4>
    <p>The automated tests we will create in this step require a Gmail account. AWS Cognito will email authorization codes 
        to that Gmail account during the tests. For instance, the sign-up process will email the new user a 
        authorization code. Our sign-up process test must log into the user's Gmail account, find the email containing 
        the authorization code and then use that code to finalize the sign-up process. </p>
        <p>AWS Cognito requires each user to have a unique email address. We don't want to create a new 
            email address each time we run the tests and deleting users from the Cognito User Pool is not
            convenient or always what we what.
        </p>
        <p>Lucky for us, Gmail has a nifty feature that allows you to use an email address 
        alias. For example, if you email address is myemail@Gmaili.com, you can send email to that address with 
        the alias myemail+01@Gmail.com. As far as AWS Cognito is concerned, this alias is a unique email address.
        This means we can use a single Gmail account to create and test multiple AWS Cognito accounts where each 
        of the AWS Cognito accounts is associated with a unique Gmail address alias.
        </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new Gmail account. We suggest you create a Gmail account just for this purpose and not use 
            any existing Gmail account.</li>
        <li>Open your Google Account Settings.</li>
        <li>Select Security from menu.</li>
        <li>Select "Less secure app access" and turn on access.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Warning: Google really doesn't like your account to allow "less secure 
        app access". They will regularly reset this setting to "on" without your permission, without warning, 
        and without notification. Before running this test suite in the future, you must check your Google 
        account settings to make sure this setting is off.
    </p>
    
    <h4>8.2 Create PetStoreTests Project</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Right Click on "Solution PetStore" in the Solution Explorer pane. The Context Menu appears.</li>
        <li>Select "Add &RightArrow; New Project" from the context menu. The "Add new project" dialog appears.</li>
        <li>Type "MSTEST Test Project (.NET Core)" into the search field. The project template is listed.</li>
        <li>Double Click on the template list item. The "Configure your project" dialog appears.</li>
        <li>Edit project name to read "PetStoreTests".</li>
        <li>Click the Create button. The test project is added to your solution.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>8.3 Add Project Dependencies</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the PetStoreTests.csproj file.</li>
            <li>Copy the following ItemGroup into the .csproj file.
                <pre><code class="language-bash">
    &lt;ItemGroup>
        &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets" Version="5.0.0" />
        &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="5.0.1" />
        &lt;ProjectReference Include="..\PetStoreClientSDK\PetStoreClientSDK.csproj" />
        &lt;EmbeddedResource Include="..\Stacks\Dev\AwsSettings.json" />
    &lt;/ItemGroup>
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>Note the inclusion of the "..\Stacks\Dev\AwsSettings.json" file as an embedded resource. This 
        file contains the information necessary for a client app to connect to and use the AWS Stack. We 
        generated this file earlier with using Tools â†’ LazyStack - Generate Stacks\Dev\AwsSettings.json.
    </p>
    <h4>8.4 Configure Visual Studio Secrets</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Right Click on PetStoreTest project in solution explorer. The Context Menu appears.</li>
        <li>Select "Manage User Secrets". A secrets.json editor tab opens.</li>
        <li>Enter your Gmail credentials in this format: <br/>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "Gmail": {
    "Email": "myemail@Gmail.com",
    "Password": "mypassword"
    }
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Save your edits.</li>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    
    <h4>8.5 Implement Tests</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Delete the PetStoreTests UnitTest1.cs file.</li>
        <li>Download <a href="/assets/tutorial/code/PetStoreTests/PetStoreIntegrationTest.cs" download>PetStoreIntegrationTest.cs</a> and 
            then move it into the PetStoreTests project.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>8.6 Run Tests</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Select View &RightArrow; Test Explorer. The Test Explorer panel appears.</li>
        <li>Run Tests. The integration test completes successfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>8.7 Step Summary</h4>
    <p>In this step we created a Integration test project and ran our first tests against 
        the published stack.
    </p>
    <p>Reviewing the contents of the PetStoreIntegrationTest.cs class may yield valuable 
        insights into how you should use the libraries in your client apps. Take note of the 
    following implementation elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/clientsdk/clientsdk_awssettings.html"{{>newtab}}>AwsSettings.json</a> is an embedded resource that is loaded by 
            ConfigurationBuilder. This embedded resource 
            references \Stacks\Dev\AwsSettings.json. In a client app, you would introduce condition logic in the 
            csproj file to use \Stacks\Prod\AwsSettings.json for release builds or just distribute the AwsSettings.json 
            file separately to developers using the PetStoreClientSDK.
        </li>
        <li><a href="/libraries/lazystackauth/lazystackauth_authmessages.html"{{>newtab}}>AuthMessages.json</a> is a embedded 
            resource that is loaded by ConfigurationBuilder. Extend 
            this file with new message sets by language to localize the messages emitted by the AuthProcess class.
            This test does not demonstrate the use of AuthProcess messages but later Tutorial steps will.
        </li>
        <li>Dependency injection is used in this test to demonstrate the service registration of 
            IAuthProcess and IAuthProvider. 
        </li>
        <li><a href="/libraries/lazystackauth/lazystackauth_lazystackauth.html"{{>newtab}}>LazyStackAuth</a> is an important 
            library in this project.
            <ul>
                <li>This test only exercises the simple Happy Path SignUp and SignIn process. If you want 
                    to see much more extensive integration tests for AuthProcess, view the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/InSciCo/LazyStack" {{>newtab}}>LazyStack</a> repo on GitHub.
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="/libraries/lazystackauth/lazystackauth_lzhttpclient.html"{{>newtab}}>LzHttpClient</a> class 
                    implements the logic necessary for 
                    your client to make secure calls to the AWS Stack ApiGateways. The LzHttpClient class uses the Aws, LoadApis and 
                    MethodMap sections in the appConfig.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
