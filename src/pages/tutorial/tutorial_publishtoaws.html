    <h3>Publish PetStoreDev stack to AWS</h3>
    <h4>4.1 Publish</h4>
    <p>In this step we will publish our stack to AWS.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Stacks\Dev folder in the Visual Studio solution explorer pane.</li>
        <li>Right Click on the serverless.template file. The Context Menu appears.</li>
        <li>Select Publish to AWS Lambda. The "Publish AWS Serverless Application" dialog appears.</li>
        <li>Enter the Stack Name: PetStoreDev.</li>
        <li>Specify an S3 Bucket to use or create a new one. The S3 bucket name must have no spaces 
            and contain no uppercase characters. For example "petstore" would work.
        </li>
        <li>Click the Publish button. The "Publish AWS Serverless Application" dialog appears and shows
            a processing log as it processes your serverless.template file and associated projects.
            When the serverless.template and projects have been processed the dialog closes.</li>
        <li>A new Visual Studio editor tab named Stack:PetStore is opened. This tab shows you the 
            progress of your stack update. You will see the status change to UPDATE COMPLETE once 
            the publishing step is finished. </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>4.2 Generate AwsSettings.json file</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Select Tools &RightArrow; LazyStack - Generate Stacks\Dev\AwsSettings.json. A LazyStack.log 
            tab opens and LazyStack log messages are displayed. A AwsSettings.json file is added 
        to the Stacks\Dev folder. This file contains the configuration settings 
        necessary for client apps to use the PetStoreDev AWS Stack.</li>
    </ol>   

    <h5>Step Summary</h5>
    <p>We published our stack to AWS, generated an AwsSettings.json file and can now use those resources.</p>
