<h3>Create Stack Repository</h3>
<p>In the LazyStack Tools Tutorial you created a PetStore Solution containing a robust serverless stack.
    You published that stack to your sandbox AWS Account and accessed that stack using a PetStore client 
    app. In this step we are going to create a GitHub repository containing your work so it can be shared 
    with others and later on be used to drive a CI/CD process. 
</p>

<h5>Visual Studio IDE (Windows) Steps</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Open the PetStore Solution in Visual Studio.</li>
    <li>Select the Visual Studio Git &rightarrow; "Create Git Repository" menu item. The Create a Git Repository dialog appears.</li>
    <li>Select your GitHub Organization in the "Owner" drop down combo. If no GitHub Organization exists, then just use your 
        GitHub Account. </li>
    <li>Edit "Repository name" to a unique value. ex: "JoePetStore".</li>
    <li>Click on the "Create and Push" button. The following actions are taken:
        <ul>
            <li>A .git folder is added in the Solution root folder.</li>
            <li>A .gitattributes file is added in the Solution root folder.</li>
            <li>A .gitignore file is added in the Solution root folder.</li>
            <li>The shared repository is added to GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
