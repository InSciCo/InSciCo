<p>In this system we are going to create a new System and add a stack to that system. To make things simple we are going 
  to use the PetStore stack developed in the LazyStack Tutorial. During the SMF installation process, a Management 
  Workstation was configured with access to the AWS Management account for an AWS Organization. In addition, individual 
  "Developer AWS Accounts" were created for each developer.

</p>
<p>This tutorial requires access to the management workstation and developer workstation. If your workstation is not configured 
  as both a management and developer workstation, then you will need to coordinate some steps in this tutorial with a 
  team member that has access to a management workstation.
