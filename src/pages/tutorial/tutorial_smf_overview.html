<p>In this tutorial we are going to add a stack to the Tutorial system created during Install Configure LazyStack SMF process. 
  We assume you have completed one of the LazyStack Tools Tutorials, so we will use that local .NET solution to create the 
  system stack. During the SMF installation process, individual AWS Accounts were created for each developer. 
  You will need the credentials produced by that process to execute this tutorial. You may have already performed the 
  Install Configure Developer Workstation process with those credentials, if not please update your Developer Workstation 
  configuration using those credentials.
</p>
<p>In addition, a GitHub Repository should have been created for you during the Install Configure LazyStack SMF process. The 
  suggested naming of that repository was "OrgDevJoePetStore" where OrgDevJoe is the name of your developer account.
