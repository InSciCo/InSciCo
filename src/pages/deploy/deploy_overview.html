    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    <p>At some point you will want to deploy your stack to production. In some cases the stack 
        might be  deployed by others. We suggest you author a Deployment Guide for your stack. 
        We provide a Deployment Guide Checklist outline to get you started. In this section 
        we point you to AWS documentation that is relevant to building and deploying 
        AWS stacks.
        In addition, we provide a Deployment Guide example for the tutorial's PetStore stack.
