    <h3>AWS Basics</h3>
    <p>This document is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology 
        officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. 
    </p>
    <p>The quick checklist is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an AWS Account. (This creates your root user.)</li>
        <li>Create an individual IAM user (Don't use your root user credentials!). </li>
        <li>Create an Organization.</li>
        <li>Create a SubAccount for Production. Create a production IAM user.</li>
        <li>Create a SubAccount for each Developer. Create a developer IAM user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Security Best Practices in IAM</h4>
    <p>"To help secure your AWS resources, follow these recommendations for the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service." <br>
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html" {{>newtab}}>Security best practices in IAM</a>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>This IAM reference is critical and provides concrete and very specific IAM usage guidelines.</strong> Since they are 
        so important, I repeat them here for reference:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lock away your AWS account root user access keys</li>
        <li>Create individual IAM users</li>
        <li>Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users</li>
        <li>Grant least privilege</li>
        <li>Get started using permissions with AWS managed policies</li>
        <li>Use customer managed policies instead of inline policies</li>
        <li>Use access levels to review IAM permissions</li>
        <li>Configure a strong password policy for your users</li>
        <li>Enable MFA</li>
        <li>Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances</li>
        <li>Use roles to delegate permissions</li>
        <li>Do not share access keys</li>
        <li>Rotate credentials regularly</li>
        <li>Remove unnecessary credentials</li>
        <li>Use policy conditions for extra security</li>
        <li>Monitor activity in your AWS account</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html" {{>newtab}}>here</a> 
        to review these 
        practices in more detail.

    <h4>AWS Organization</h4>
    <p>"AWS Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow 
        and scale your AWS resources. Using AWS Organizations, you can programmatically create 
        new AWS accounts and allocate resources, group accounts to organize your workflows, 
        apply policies to accounts or groups for governance, and simplify billing by using 
        a single payment method for all of your accounts." <br><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/"
        {{>newtab}}>AWS Organizations</a>
        <p><strong>We recommend using Organizations to create multiple accounts to support
            separation of concerns and make it more convenient to define and manage IAM Roles 
            for development, test and production stacks.
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AWS Well-Architected Guidance</h4>
    <p>"The AWS Well-Architected Framework describes the key concepts, design principles, 
        and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud. 
        By answering a set of foundational questions, you learn how well your architecture 
        aligns with cloud best practices and are provided guidance for making improvements." <br>

    <h4>Serverless Applications Lens - AWS Well-Architected</h4>
    <p>"This document describes the Serverless Applications Lens for the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
        The document covers common serverless applications scenarios and identifies key elements to 
        ensure that your workloads are architected according to best practices." <br>

        {{>newtab}}>
            Serverless Applications Lens - AWS Well-Architected</a>
    </p>
    <p>We strongly recommend that you read this whitepaper as it provides you with insights on what 
        additional serverless resources you can use in your serverless stacks and what considerations 
        you need to keep in mind when doing so.
