    <h3>LazyStack Deployment Technical Base Requirements</h3>
    <p>LazyStack is a tool that generates AWS SAM Templates that are used to publish 
        AWS Stacks. In addition to the AWS Account Basics, the following additional 
        requirements apply to LazyStack.
    </p>

    <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>C# and Command Shell</li>
        <li>.NET</li>
        <li>OpenApi Specification</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>AWS Command Line Interface</h4>
    <p>"The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool that provides a 
        consistent interface for interacting with all parts of AWS. AWS CLI commands 
        for different services are covered in the accompanying user guide, 
        including descriptions, syntax, and usage examples." <br>
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html" {{>newtab}}>AWS Command 
        Line Interface</a></p>

    <h4>AWS Serverless Applications Model (SAM)</h4>
    <p>The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. <br>
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a>
    </p>

    <h4>AWS SAM Command Line Interface</h4>
    <p>"The AWS SAM CLI is a command line tool that operates on an AWS SAM template 
        and application code. With the AWS SAM CLI, you can invoke Lambda functions 
        locally, create a deployment package for your serverless application, 
        deploy your serverless application to the AWS Cloud, and so on." <br>

            AWS SAM CLI</a>
    </p>

    <h4>AWS ToolKit for Visual Studio (Windows Only)</h4>
    <p>"The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is a plugin for the Visual Studio IDE 
        that makes it easier for you to develop, debug, and deploy .NET applications 
        that use Amazon Web Services. The Toolkit for Visual Studio is supported 
        for Visual Studio versions 2013 and later."  <br>

    <h4>Source Code Management</h4>
    <p>A source code management system like GitHub. Many other Git based 
        services are also excellent choices. Some of these include BitBucket, GitLab 
        and AWS CodeCommit. We recommend that you implement the Git Flow workflow, 
        Git Flow is supported by most Git repository services. 
    </p>

    <h4>Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) System</h4>
    <p>It is highly recommended that you use a CI/CD system. We are currently 
        working on an example workflow based on Git Flow, Pull Requests and the 
        use of the AWS CodePipeline service. LazyStack easily integrates with 
        CI/CD pipelines.
