LazyStack is a passion project by a couple of nerds. We love generated code but we don't love 
the pricing models of existing low-code platforms (or being locked into their eco-system). 
This made us ask: "What if you could field an entire application using only the 'free-tier' 
of cloud providers". That way, you could demonstrate revenue to investors before committing 
serious capital. Luckily, Microsoft .Net and C# provides almost everything we need... if 
only we had a way of connecting it to the undisputed king of cloud: AWS. Enter 'LazyStack', 
our one stop shop for C# front-end/AWS back-end solutions. Install our Visual Studio 
extension and leapfrog months of development with a single click.
